<p class="chaptitle">A NIGHT MYSTERY.</p>


<p>"Oh, py shiminy! Look at dere, vonce! Vat it iss,
Matt? Br-r-r! I feel like I vould t'row some fits righdt
on der shpot! It's a shpook, you bed you!"</p>

<p>A strange event was going forward, there under the
moon and stars of that New Mexico night. The wagon-road
followed the base of a clifflike bank, and at the
outer edge of the road there was a precipitous fall into
Stygian darkness.</p>

<p>A second road entered the first through a narrow
gully. A few yards beyond the point where the thoroughfares
joined an automobile was halted, its twin acetylene
lamps gleaming like the eyes of some fabled monster in
the semigloom.</p>

<p>Two boys were on the front seat of the automobile, and
one of them had leaned over and gripped the arm of the
lad who had his hands on the steering-wheel. The eyes
of the two in the car were staring ahead.</p>

<p>What the boys saw was sufficiently startling, in all
truth.</p>

<p>Out of the gully, directly in advance of them, had
rolled a white automobile&mdash;springing ghostlike out of
the darkness as it came under the glare of the acetylene
lights.</p>

<p>The white car was a runabout, with two seats in front
and an abnormally high deck behind. It carried no
lamps, moved with weird silence, and, strangest of all,
<i>there was no one in either seat</i>! Yet, with no hand on
the steering-wheel, the white car made the dangerous
turn out of the gully into the main road with the utmost
ease, and was now continuing on between the foot of the
cliff and the brink of the chasm with a steadiness that
was&mdash;well, almost hair-raising.</p>

<p>Motor Matt, who had been piloting the Red Flier
slowly and carefully along that dangerous course, had
cut off the power and thrown on the brake the instant
the white car leaped into sight. As he gazed at the
receding auto, and noted the conditions under which it
was moving, a gasp escaped his lips.</p>

<p>"That beats anything I ever heard of, Carl!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"It vas a shpook pubble!" clamored Carl Pretzel. "I
don'd like dot, py shinks. Durn aroundt, or pack oop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
or do somet'ing else to ged oudt oof der vay. Shpooks
iss pad pitzness, und schust vy dit it habben don't make
no odds aboudt der tifference. Ged avay, Matt, und ged
avay kevick! Py Chorge! I vas so vorked oop as I
can't dell."</p>

<p>Carl released Matt's arm, pulled a big red handkerchief
out of his pocket and wiped the perspiration from
his face. He was having a chill and perspiring at the
same time; and his mop of towlike hair was trying to
stand on end.</p>

<p>Matt started the Red Flier. There was gas enough
in the cylinders to take the spark, so that it was not
necessary to get out and use the crank.</p>

<p>To turn around on such a road was out of the question,
even if Matt had desired to do so&mdash;which he did
not. Nor did he reverse the engine and back away, but
started along in the trail of the white car.</p>

<p>"Vat you vas doing, anyvay?" cried Carl.</p>

<p>"I'm going to follow up that phantom auto and see if
I can find what controls it."</p>

<p>"You vas grazy, Matt! Meppy ve ged kilt oof ve ged
too nosey mit dot machine. It don'd pay to dake some
chances in a case like dose. I know vat I know, und
dot's all aboudt it. Go pack pefore der shpook pubble
hits us und knock us py der cliff ofer!"</p>

<p>Carl was excited. He believed in "spooks" and Motor
Matt didn't, and that was all the difference between them.</p>

<p>"Don't lose your nerve, Carl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It vas gone alretty!" groaned Carl, crouching in his
seat, hanging on with both hands and staring ahead with
popping eyes.</p>

<p>"Nothing's going to happen," went on Matt. "There's
no such thing as ghosts, Carl."</p>

<p>"Don'd I know ven I see vone?" quavered Carl. "You
t'ink I vas plind, Matt. Dot pubble moofs mitoudt nopody
to make it go like vat it does; und it don'd hit der
rocks or go ofer der cliff. Donnervetter! I vish I vas
somevere else, py grickets. Ach! I vas so colt like ice,
und I sveat; und my teet' raddle so dot I don't hardly
peen aple to shpeak anyt'ing."</p>

<p>"We've seen the Red Flier moving along without anybody
aboard, Carl," said Matt, in an attempt to quiet his
chum's fears.</p>

<p>"Yah, so," answered Carl, "aber der Ret Flier vas
moofing along some shdraighdt roads, und der veel vas
tied mit ropes so dot she keeps a shdraighdt course.
Aber dot shpook pubble don'd haf nopody on, und der
veel ain'd tied, und yet she go on und on like anyding.
Ach, I peen as goot as a deadt Dutchman, I know dot."</p>

<p>While the boys were thus arguing matters the Red
Flier was trailing the phantom auto. The white machine,
still controlled in some mysterious manner, glided safely
along the treacherous trail. It was beyond the glow of
the acetylene lights, but the moonlight brought it out of
the gloom like a white blur.</p>

<p>In advance of the runabout Matt saw a place where
the road curved around the face of the cliff. The phantom
auto melted around the curve.</p>

<p>Hardly had it vanished when a loud yell was wafted
back to the ears of the boys.</p>

<p>Carl nearly jumped out of his seat, and a frightened
whoop escaped his lips.</p>

<p>"Ach, du lieber!" he wailed. "Ve vas goners, Matt,
ve vas bot' goners. I can't t'ink oof nodding, nod efen
my brayers! Vat vas dot? I bed you it vas der teufel
gedding retty to chump on us. Whoosh! I never had
some feelings like dis yet."</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish, Carl," said Matt. "There was no
spook back of that yell, but real flesh and blood. Keep a
stiff upper lip and we'll find out all about it."</p>

<p>Just then the Red Flier rounded the turn. A long,
straightaway course lay ahead of the boys, lighted
brightly by the lamps and, farther on, by the moon and
stars. But <i>the phantom auto had vanished</i>!</p>

<p>Matt was astounded, and brought the Red Flier to a
halt once more. With a high wall of rock on one side of
the road, and an abyss on the other, where could the
white car have gone?</p>

<p>"Ach, chiminy!" chattered Carl. "Poof, und avay she
goes. Der pubble vas snuffed oudt, und schust meldet
indo der moonpeams. Dis vas a hoodoo pitzness, all
righdt. Ve ged der douple-gross pooty soon, I bed you
someding for nodding!"</p>

<p>"But that yell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Der teufel make him! Id don'd vas nodding but der
shpook feller, saying in der shpook languge, 'Ah, ha, I
ged you pooty kevick!' I vish dot I hat vings so I could
fly avay mit meinseluf."</p>

<p>Matt got down from the car and started to walk forward.
Carl let off a yell and scrambled after him.</p>

<p>"Don'd leaf me, Matt! It vas goot to be mit somepody
ad sooch a dime. Misery lofes gompany, und dot's
vat I need."</p>

<p>"Come on, then," laughed Matt.</p>

<p>"Vere you go, hey?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to see if I can discover what became of
that car."</p>

<p>"It vent oop on der moonpeams," averred Carl
earnestly. "You can look, und look, und dot's all der
goot it vill do. Dake it from me, Matt, dot ve don'd
vas&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ahoy, up there!"</p>

<p>The words seem to come from nowhere&mdash;or, rather,
from everywhere, which was equivalent to the same thing.</p>

<p>Carl gave a roar and tried to push himself into the
face of the cliff.</p>

<p>"Vat I tell you, hey?" he groaned. "Dere it vas again.
Matt, more und vorse dan der odder dime. Righdt here
iss vere ve kick some puckets; yah, leedle Carl Pretzel
und Modor Matt King vill be viped oudt like a sponge
mit a slate."</p>

<p>"Keep still, Carl!" called Matt. "There's no ghost
back of that voice. Listen a minute."</p>

<p>Turning in the road, Matt lifted his head.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he called.</p>

<p>"Hello, yourself!" came the muffled but distinct response.</p>

<p>The voice seemed to float out of the blackness of the
chasm, and Matt stepped closer to the edge.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My name'll be M-u-d, Mud, if you don't man a line
an' give me a boost out of this."</p>

<p>"Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Down the wall, hanging like a lizard to a piece of
scrub. Can't you tell by my talk where I am? From the
looks, I'm about a fathom down; but I'll be all the way
down if you don't get a move on. Shake yourself together,
mate, and be lively!"</p>

<p>Carl's fear, as this conversation proceeded, was gradually
lost in curiosity. The voice from over the brink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
had a very human ring to it, and the Dutch boy was beginning
to feel easier in his mind.</p>

<p>"Get the rope out of the tonneau, Carl," called Matt.
"Hurry up!"</p>

<p>"Bully!" came from below, the person on the wall evidently
hearing Matt's order to Carl. "That's the game,
matey. If you've got a rope, reeve a bowline in the end
and toss it over. I'm a swab if I don't think it's up
to you to do it, too. I wouldn't have slid over the edge
if your white devil-wagon hadn't made me dodge out of
the way. How'd it&mdash;Wow!"</p>

<p>The voice below broke off with a startled whoop.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" called Matt.</p>

<p>"The bush pulled out a little," was the answer, "and
I thought I was gone. Rush things up there, will you?"</p>

<p>At that moment Carl came with the rope, and Matt,
standing above the place where he supposed the unseen
speaker to be, allowed the noosed end to slide down to
him.</p>

<p>"I've got it!" cried the voice. "Are you ready to
lay on?"</p>

<p>"Catch hold, Carl," said Matt, "and brace yourself.
All ready," he shouted, when he and Carl were planted
firmly with the rope in their hands.</p>

<p>"Then here goes!"</p>

<p>The rope grew taut under a suddenly imposed weight,
and Matt and Carl laid back on it and hauled in.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DICK FERRAL.</p>


<p>A young fellow of seventeen or eighteen crawled over
the brink of the chasm and sat on the rocks to breathe
himself. The lamps of the Red Flier shone full on him,
so that Matt and Carl were easily able to take his sizing.</p>

<p>He wore a flannel shirt, cowboy-hat and high-heeled
boots. His trousers were tucked in his boot-tops. His
bronzed face was clean-cut, and he had clear, steady eyes.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that just naturally rattle your spurs?" he
asked, looking Matt and Carl over as he talked. "I
thought you fellows had put a stamp on that rope and
were sending it by mail. It seemed like a good while
coming, but maybe that was because I was hangin' to a
twig and three leaves with the skin of my teeth." He
swerved his eyes to the Red Flier. "You've lit your
candles," he added, "since you scared me out of a year's
growth by flashin' around that bend. If you'd had the
lights going <i>then</i>, I guess I could have crowded up
against the cliff instead of makin' a jump t'other way and
going over the edge."</p>

<p>"You vas wrong mit dot," said Carl. "It vasn't us vat
come along und knocked you py der gulch."</p>

<p>"That's the truth," added Matt, noting the stranger's
startled expression. "We were following that other automobile,
and stopped when we heard you yell."</p>

<p>Without a word the rescued youth got up and went
back to give the Red Flier a closer inspection. When he
returned, he seemed entirely satisfied that he had made
a mistake.</p>

<p>"I did slip my hawser on that first idea, and no mistake,"
said he. "As I went over, I saw out of the clew
of my eye that the other flugee was white. Yours is
bigger, and painted different. What are your names,
mates?"</p>

<p>Matt introduced himself and Carl.</p>

<p>"I'm Dick Ferral," went on the other, shaking hands
heartily, "and when I'm at home, which is about once in
six years, I let go the anchor in Hamilton, Ontario. I'm
a sailor, most of the time, but for the last six months
I've been punching cattle in the Texas Panhandle. A
crimp annexed my money, back there in Lamy, and I'm
rolling along toward an old ranch my uncle used to
own, called La Vita Place. It can't be far from here,
if I'm not off my bearings. Where are you bound,
mates, in that steam hooker?"</p>

<p>"Santa Fé," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"Own that craft?" and Dick Ferral nodded toward the
car.</p>

<p>"No; it belongs to a man named Tomlinson, who lives
in Denver. Carl and I brought it to Albuquerque for
him. When we got there, we found a line from him
asking us to bring the car on to Santa Fé. If we got
there in two weeks he said it would be time enough, so
we're jogging along and taking things easy."</p>

<p>"If you've got plenty of time, I shouldn't think you'd
want to do any cruising in waters like these, unless you
had daylight to steer by."</p>

<p>"We'd have reached the next town before sunset,"
Matt answered, "if we hadn't had trouble with a tire."</p>

<p>"It was a good thing for me you were behind your
schedule, and happened along just after I turned a handspring
over the cliff. If you hadn't, Davy Jones would
have had me by this time. But what became of that
other craft? I didn't have much time to look at it, for
it came foaming along full and by, at a forty-knot gait,
but as I slid over the rock I couldn't see a soul aboard."</p>

<p>"No more dere vasn't," said Carl earnestly. "Dot vas
a shpook pubble, Verral. You see him, und ve see him,
aber he don'd vas dere; nodding, nodding at all only
schust moonshine!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" Ferral cast an odd glance at Motor
Matt. "That old flugee was a sort of Flying Dutchman,
hey?"</p>

<p>"I don'd know somet'ing about dot," answered Carl,
shaking his head gruesomely, "aber I bed you it vas a
shpook."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any one on the car," put in Matt, "and
it's a mystery how it traveled this road like it did. It
came out of a gully, farther back around the bend, right
ahead of us. We followed it, and when we had come
around that turn it had vanished."</p>

<p>"What you say takes me all aback, messmates," said
Ferral. "I'm no believer in ghost-stories, but this one
of yours stacks up nearer the real thing in that line than
any I ever heard. Say," and Ferral seemed to have a
sudden idea, "if you fellows want a berth for the night,
why not put in at La Vita Place?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Matt, vy nod?" urged Carl.</p>

<p>"How far is it, Ferral?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"It can't be far from here, although I'm a bit off
soundings on this part of the chart. I've never been to
Uncle Jack's before&mdash;and shame on me to say it&mdash;and
likely I wouldn't be going there now if the old gentleman
hadn't dropped off, leaving things in a bally mix.
They say I'm to get my whack from the estate, if a will
can be found, although I don't know why anything should
come to me. I've always been a rover, and Uncle Jack
didn't like it. My cousin, Ralph Sercomb&mdash;I never liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
him and wouldn't trust him the length of a lead line&mdash;stands
to win his pile by the same will. Ralph is at the
ranch, and, I suppose, waitin' for me with open arms and
a knife up his sleeve."</p>

<p>"When did your uncle die?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"As near as I can find out, he just simply vanished.
All he left was a line saying he was tired of living alone,
that he never could get me to give up my roaming and
come and stay with him, and that while Ralph came often
and did what he could to cheer him up, he had always
had a soft place in his heart for me, and missed me. He
said, too, in that last writing of his, that when he was
found his will would be found with him, and that he
hoped Ralph and I would stay at the ranch until the will
turned up. That's what came to me, down in the Texas
Panhandle, from a lawyer in Lamy. As soon as I got
that I felt like a swab. Here I've been knockin' around
the world ever since I was ten, Uncle Jack wanting me
all the time and me holding back. Now I'm coming to
the ranch like a pirate. Anyhow, that's the way it looks.
If Uncle Jack was alive he'd say, 'You couldn't come just
to see me, Dick, but now that I'm gone, and have left
you something, you're quick enough to show up.'"</p>

<p>Ferral turned away and looked down into the blackness
of the gulch. He faced about, presently, and went on:</p>

<p>"But it wasn't Uncle Jack's money that brought me.
Now, when it's too late, I'm trying to do the right thing&mdash;and
to make up for what I ought to have done and
didn't do in the past. A fellow like me is thoughtless.
He never understands where he's failed in his duty till
a blow like this brings it home to him. He's the only
relative Ralph and I had left, and I've acted like a misbemannered
Sou'wegian.</p>

<p>"When I went to sea, I shipped from Halifax on the
<i>Billy Ruffian</i>, as we called her, although she's down on the
navy list as the <i>Bellerophon</i>. From there I was transferred
to the South African station, and the transferring
went on and on till my time was out, and I found myself
down in British Honduras. Left there to come across
the Gulf of Galveston, and worked my way up into the
Texas Panhandle, where I navigated the Staked Plains
on a cow-horse. Had six months of that, when along
came the lawyer's letter, and I tripped anchor and bore
away for here. As I told you, a crimp did me out of
my roll in Lamy. He claimed to be a fellow Canuck in
distress, and I was going with him to his hotel to see
what I could do to help him out. He led me into a dark
street, and somebody hit me from behind and I went
down and out with a slumber-song. Then I got up and
laid a course for Uncle Jack's. If you'll go with me the
rest of the way, I'll like it, and you might just as well
stop over at La Vita Place and make a fresh start for
Santa Fé in the morning."</p>

<p>"We'll do it," answered Matt, who was liking Dick
Ferral more and more as he talked.</p>

<p>"Dot's der shtuff!" chirped Carl. "Oof you got somet'ing
to eat at der ranch, und a ped to shleep on, ve vill
ged along fine."</p>

<p>"I guess we can find all that at the place, although I
don't think the ranch amounts to much. Uncle Jack was
queer&mdash;not unhinged, mind you, only just a bit different
from ordinary people. He never did a thing in quite the
same way some one else would do it. When he left
England, a dozen years ago, he stopped with us a while
in Hamilton, and then came on here and bought an old
Mexican <i>casa</i>. He wanted to get away from folks, he
said, but I guess he got tired of it; if he hadn't, he
wouldn't have been so dead set on having me with him
after my parents died. The bulk of his money is across
the water. But hang his money! It's Uncle Jack himself
I'm thinking about, now."</p>

<p>"We'll get into the car," said Matt, "and go on a hunt
for La Vita Place."</p>

<p>Matt stepped to the crank. As he bent over it, Carl
gave a frightened shout.</p>

<p>"Look vonce!" he quavered, pointing along the road
with a shaking finger. "Dere iss some more oof der
shpooks!"</p>

<p>Matt started up and whirled around. Perhaps a hundred
feet from where the three boys were standing, a
dim figure could be seen, silvered uncannily by the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Great guns, Carl!" muttered Matt. "Your nerves
must be in pretty bad shape. That's a man, and he's
been walking toward us while we were talking."</p>

<p>"Vy don'd he come on some more, den?" asked Carl.
"Vat iss he shtandin' shdill mit himseluf for? Vy don'd
he shpeak oudt und say somet'ing?"</p>

<p>"Hello!" called Ferral. "How far is it to La Vita
Place, pilgrim?"</p>

<p>The form did not answer, but continued to stand rigid
and erect in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Ve'd pedder ged oudt oof dis so kevick as ve can,"
faltered Carl, crouching back under the shadow of the
car. "I don'd like der looks oof dot feller."</p>

<p>"Let's get closer to him, Ferral," suggested Matt,
starting along the road at a run.</p>

<p>"It's main queer the way he's actin', and no mistake,"
muttered Ferral, starting after Matt.</p>

<p>Matt was about half-way to the motionless figure, when
it melted slowly into the black shadow of the cliff. On
reaching the place where the figure had stood, it was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, Ferral?" Matt asked in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>Ferral did not reply. His eyes were bright and staring,
and he leaned against the rock wall and drew a dazed
hand across his brows.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">LA VITA PLACE.</p>


<p>"I'm all ahoo, and that's the truth of it," muttered
Ferral. "This is the greatest place for seein' things, and
then losin' track of 'em, that I ever got into. There was
certainly a man standing right there where you are,
wasn't there?"</p>

<p>"That's the way it looked to me," answered Matt. "It
can't be that we were all fooled. Imagination might
have played hob with one of us, but it couldn't with all
three."</p>

<p>Ferral peered around him then looked over the shelf
into the gulch, and up toward the top of the cliff.</p>

<p>"Well, sink me, if this ain't the queerest business I
ever ran into! Some one must be hoaxin' us."</p>

<p>"Why should any one do that?" asked Matt. "What
have they got to gain by such foolishness?"</p>

<p>"I'm over my head. There's no use staying here,
though, overhaulin' our jaw-tackle. Let's go on to the
ranch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the ticket! If what we've seen and can't
understand means anything to us, it's bound to come
out."</p>

<p>They started back.</p>

<p>"Are you on good terms with your cousin, Ralph Sercomb?"
Matt asked, as they walked along.</p>

<p>"The last time I saw him was six years ago, when I
came to Hamilton to settle up my father's estate. Ralph
was there, and I licked him. I can't remember what it
was for, but I did it proper. He was always more or less
of a sneak, but he's got one of these angel-faces, and to
take his sizing offhand no one would ever think he'd do
anything wrong."</p>

<p>"Does he live in Hamilton?"</p>

<p>"No, in Denver. His mother and my mother were
Uncle Jack's sisters. Last I heard of Ralph he was driving
a racing-automobile for a manufacturing firm&mdash;a
little in your line, I guess, eh?"</p>

<p>By that time the two boys had got back to the machine.
Carl was up in front, imagining all sorts of things.</p>

<p>"I peen hearing funny noises," he remarked, as Matt
"turned over" the engine and then got up in the driver's
seat, "und dey keep chabbering, 'Don'd go on, go pack,
go pack,' schust like dot. I t'ink meppy ve pedder go
pack, Matt."</p>

<p>"We can't go back, Carl," returned Matt, starting the
machine as soon as Ferral had climbed into the tonneau.
"We couldn't turn around in this road even if we
wanted to."</p>

<p>"Vell, hurry oop und ged avay from dis shpooky blace.
Der kevicker vat ve do dot, der pedder off ve vas. I got
some feelings dot dere is drouple aheadt. Dot shpook
plew indo nodding ven you come oop mit it, hey?"</p>

<p>"The man vanished mysteriously&mdash;that's the size of it.
If it was daylight, we might be able to figure out how he
got away so suddenly."</p>

<p>Under Motor Matt's skilful guidance the Red Flier
ran purring along the dangerous road. Half a mile
brought the car and its passengers to the end of the cliff
and the chasm, and they whirled out into level country,
covered with brush and trees.</p>

<p>"There's a light ahead, mates!" announced Ferral,
leaning over the back of the front seat, and pointing.
"It's on the port side, too, and that agrees with the instructions
I got on leaving Lamy. That's La Vita Place,
all right enough, and Ralph's at home if that light is any
indication."</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that the house was almost screened
from the road by trees and bushes, it was impossible for
the boys to see much of it. The single light winked at
them through a gap in the tree-branches, and was evidently
shining from an up-stairs window.</p>

<p>"While you're routing out your cousin and telling him
he has company for the night, Ferral," said Matt, turning
from the road, "Carl and I will look for a place to leave
the car."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, pard," assented Ferral, jumping out. "There
must be a barn or something, I should think. Go around
toward the back of the house."</p>

<p>There was a blind road leading through the dark grove
toward the rear of the place. The car's lamps shot a
gleam ahead and Matt pushed onward carefully. When
he and Carl came opposite the side of the house, they
heard voices, somewhere within the building, talking
loudly. They could not distinguish what was said, as
the intervening wall of the building smothered the words.</p>

<p>"Ve don't vas der only gompany vat dey haf do-nighdt,
Matt," remarked Carl, in a tone of huge relief. "It feels
goot to be so glose py so many real peoples afder dot
shpook pitzness."</p>

<p>"I didn't think you believed in ghosts, Carl," laughed
Matt.</p>

<p>"Vell, a feller vas a fool ven he don'd pelieve vat he
sees, ain'd he?"</p>

<p>"That depends on how he looks at what he sees."</p>

<p>This was too deep for Carl, and before he could frame
an answer, Matt brought the Red Flier to a halt in front
of a small stone barn.</p>

<p>The barn had a wide door, and Matt got out, took the
tail lamp and went forward to investigate. Opening one
of the double doors, he stepped inside.</p>

<p>The barn was a crude affair, the stones having been
laid up without mortar. The roof consisted of a thatch
of poles and boughs, overlaid with earth.</p>

<p>There was plenty of room in the structure, however,
for the machine, and there were no horses in the place to
damage it.</p>

<p>While Carl opened both doors, Matt ran the Red Flier
into its temporary garage. Just as they had closed the
doors and were about to start for the house, Ferral ran
up to them out of the darkness.</p>

<p>"Here's a go!" he exclaimed. "I pounded on the front
door till I was blue in the face, and no one showed up."</p>

<p>"There's some one in the house, all right," declared
Matt. "Carl and I heard them."</p>

<p>"Sure ve dit," struck in Carl, "so blain as anyt'ing.
Und dare vas a lighdt, Verral&mdash;ve all saw der lighdt."</p>

<p>"Well, there's no noise inside the house now, and no
light, either," replied the perplexed Ferral. "What sort
of a blooming place is it? As soon as I began pounding
on the door, the voices died out and the light vanished
from the window."</p>

<p>"Are you positive this is La Vita Place?" asked Matt,
with a sudden thought that they might have made a mistake.</p>

<p>Ferral himself had said that he had never been to the
ranch before, and it was very possible he had gone wrong
in following directions.</p>

<p>"Call me a lubber if I ain't," answered Ferral decidedly.
"Come around front and I'll show you."</p>

<p>Together the three boys made their way back through
the gloomy grove, turned the corner of the building and
brought up at the front door. The house continued dark
and silent.</p>

<p>Ferral scratched a match and held the flickering taper
at arm's length over his head.</p>

<p>"Look at that printing above the door," said he.</p>

<p>There, plainly enough, were the rudely painted words,
"La Vita Place."</p>

<p>"We're takin' our scope of cable this far, all right,"
observed Ferral, dropping the match and laying a hand
on the door-knob, "and I guess I've got as good a right
in Uncle Jack's house as anybody. Open up, I say!" he
shouted, and shook the door vigorously.</p>

<p>No one answered. Not a sound could be heard inside
the building.</p>

<p>Matt stepped back and ran his eye over the gloomy
outline of the structure.</p>

<p>It was a two-story adobe, the windows small and
deeply set in the thick walls. The window through which
the light had been seen was now as dark as the others.
This was as puzzling as any of the other events of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
night, but it could be explained. Those inside were not
in a mood to receive callers; but, even if that was the
case, why could not some one come to the door and
say so?</p>

<p>"I'm going to get in," said Ferral decidedly, stepping
back as though he would kick the door open.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," suggested Matt, "and let's see if the
kitchen door isn't unlocked."</p>

<p>"It isn't&mdash;I've tried it."</p>

<p>"How about the windows?"</p>

<p>"The lower ones are all fastened."</p>

<p>"Then I'll try one of the upper ones."</p>

<p>There was a tree close to the corner of the house with
a branch swinging close to the window through which
the boys had seen the light. Watched by Ferral and
Carl, Matt climbed the tree and made his way carefully
out along the branch. When opposite the window, he
was able to step one foot on the deep sill and balance
himself while lifting the sash.</p>

<p>"It's unlocked!" he called down softly. "I'll get inside
and open the door."</p>

<p>"There's no telling what you'll find inside there," Ferral
called back. "We'll all climb up and get in at the window,
then look through the house together."</p>

<p>Carl was beginning to have "spooky" feelings again.
Not wanting to be left alone by the front door, he insisted
on being the next one to climb the tree. Matt, who had
got into the house, reached out and gave his Dutch chum
a helping hand. When Ferral came, they both gave him
a lift, and all three were presently inside the up-stairs
room.</p>

<p>"There's been somebody here, and not so very long
ago," said Matt. "I smell tobacco smoke."</p>

<p>"It's t'ick enough to cut mit a knife," sniffed Carl.</p>

<p>"I'll strike a match and look for a lamp," said Ferral,
"then we can see what we're doing."</p>

<p>As the little flame flickered up in his hands, the boys
took in the dimensions of a small, square room. A table
with four chairs around it stood in the center of the
room, and on the table was a pack of cards, left, apparently,
in the middle of the game. In the midst of
the cards stood a lamp.</p>

<p>Ferral lighted the lamp.</p>

<p>"Four people were here," said he, picking up the lamp,
"and it's an easy guess they can't be far away. We'll
cruise around a little and see what we can find."</p>

<p>Opening the only door that led out of the room, Ferral
stepped into the hall. Just as he did so, a sharp, incisive
report echoed through the house. A crash of glass followed,
and Ferral was blotted out in darkness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE HOUSE OF WONDER.</p>


<p>"Ferral!" cried Matt in trepidation.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" answered the voice of Ferral.</p>

<p>"Hurt?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, matey. Strike me lucky, though, if I
didn't have a tight squeak of it. The lamp-chimney was
smashed and the light put out. If the bullet had gone a
few inches lower, the lamp itself would have been
knocked into smithereens and I'd have been fair covered
with blazing oil. That flare-up proves the skulkers are
still aboard." He lifted his voice. "Ahoy, there, you
pirates! What're you running afoul o' me like that for?
I've a right here, being Dick Ferral, of the old <i>Billy
Ruffian</i>. Mr. Lawton's my uncle."</p>

<p>Silence fell with the last word. There were no sounds
in the house, apart from the quiet, sharp breathing of
the three boys. Outside the faint night wind soughed
through the trees, making a sort of moan that was hard
on the nerves.</p>

<p>Carl went groping for Matt, giving a grunt of satisfaction
when he reached him and took a firm hold of his
coat-tails.</p>

<p>"Ve pedder go py der vinder vonce again," suggested
Carl, catching his breath, "make some shneaks py der
pubble und ged apsent mit ourselufs. Ven pulleds come
ad you from der tark it vas pedder dot you ain'd aroundt.
Somepody don'd vant us here."</p>

<p>"I'm here because it's my duty," said Ferral, still in
the hall, "and by the same token I've got to stay here
and overhaul the whole blooming layout&mdash;but it ain't
right to ring you in on such a rough deal. You and the
Dutchman can up anchor and bear away, Matt, and I'll
still be mighty obliged for your bowsing me off that
piece of wall, and sorry, too, you couldn't be treated better
under my uncle's roof."</p>

<p>"You're not going to cut loose from us like that, Ferral,"
replied Matt. "We'll stay with you till this queer
affair straightens out more to your liking."</p>

<p>"But the danger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, we've faced music of that kind before."</p>

<p>"Bully for you, old ship!" cried Ferral heartily. "I'll
never forget it, either. Now, sink me, I'm going through
this cabin from bulkhead to bulkhead, and if I can lay
hands on that deacon-faced Sercomb, he'll tell me the
why of this or I'll wring his neck for him."</p>

<p>Matt stepped resolutely into the hall and ranged himself
at Ferral's side. Ferral was drawing a match over
the wall. The gleam of light would make targets of the
boys for their unseen enemies, but there would have to
be light if the investigation was to be thorough.</p>

<p>No shot came.</p>

<p>"Either we've got the swabs on the run," muttered
Ferral, "or I'm a point off. The lamp's out of commission,
so I'll leave it here on the floor. We've got to find
another."</p>

<p>"Be jeerful, be jeerful," mumbled Carl. "Efen dough
ve ged shot fuller oof holes as some bepper-poxes it vas
pedder dot ve be jeerful."</p>

<p>"Right-o," answered Ferral, moving off along the hall.
"Only two rooms on this floor," he added, looking
around; "we'll go into the other and try for a lamp we
can use."</p>

<p>The door of the second room opened off the hall
directly opposite the door of the first. The boys stepped
in and found themselves in a bedroom. There was a
rack of books on the wall, a trunk&mdash;open and contents
scattered&mdash;carpet torn up and bed disarranged.</p>

<p>"Looks like a hurricane had bounced in here," remarked
Ferral.</p>

<p>"Here's a candle," said Matt, and lifted the candlestick
from the table and held it for Ferral to touch the
match to the wick.</p>

<p>When the candle was alight, Ferral stepped to the table
and looked at a portrait swinging from the wall. It
was the portrait of a gray-haired man. A broad ribbon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
crossed his breast and the insignia of some order hung
against it. In spite of the surrounding perils, Ferral took
off his hat.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jack," he murmured, his voice vibrant with
feeling. "The warmest corner of my heart is set aside
for his memory, mates. I wish I'd done more for his
comfort when he was alive."</p>

<p>He turned away abruptly.</p>

<p>"But we can't lose time here. What have you got
there, Matt?"</p>

<p>Matt had seen a sword swinging from the wall. Drawing
the blade from its scabbard, he was holding it in his
hand.</p>

<p>"I'd thought of borrowing this," said he, "until we
see what's ahead."</p>

<p>"That's a regular jim-hickey of an idea!"</p>

<p>With one hand Ferral twitched at a lanyard about his
neck and brought out a dirk.</p>

<p>"I might as well carry this, too," he added.</p>

<p>"Und vat vill I do some fighding mit?" asked Carl
anxiously. "I don'd got anyt'ing more as a chack-knife."</p>

<p>"You stay behind and act as rear-guard, Carl," said
Matt. "Dick and I will go ahead."</p>

<p>With sword and dirk in readiness for instant use, Matt
and Ferral forged along the short hall to the stairs, peering
carefully around them as they went. They did not
see anything of their enemies and could not hear a sound
apart from the noise they made themselves.</p>

<p>The flickering gleams of the candle showed a number
of rich furnishings in the lower hall. The first story consisted
of three rooms, parlor, library and kitchen. The
parlor covered one side of the house, and was divided by
a passage from the two rooms on the other side.</p>

<p>But in none of the rooms, nor the hall, was any of their
lurking foes to be seen!</p>

<p>"Dis vas der plamedest t'ing vat efer habbened!" whispered
Carl. "A rekular vonder-house! Noises, und
lights, und pulleds, und nopody aroundt."</p>

<p>"Wait," warned Ferral, making for an open door that
evidently led into the cellar, "we haven't looked through
the hold yet. We'll go down and get closer to bilge-water!
I warrant you we'll stir up the rats."</p>

<p>They descended a short flight of stairs into a rock-walled
cellar. The cellar covered the entire lower part
of the house, and was so high as to leave plenty of head-room.</p>

<p>On a shelf were a number of cobwebbed bottles, and
in one corner was a bin of potatoes&mdash;but there were no
enemies in the cellar.</p>

<p>"Shiver me!" muttered Ferral, peering dazedly at Matt
through the flickering gleams of the candle. "How do
you account for this?"</p>

<p>"The four people who were here," returned Matt,
"must have got out while we were in your uncle's room.
If they have gone to the barn and tampered with the
Red Flier&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>This startling thought turned Motor Matt to the right
about, and he raced back to the first floor. Carl and
Ferral followed him swiftly.</p>

<p>There were only two outside doors to the house, one
leading from the kitchen, and the other from the front
hall.</p>

<p>Investigation showed that both of these doors were
bolted on the inside.</p>

<p>All the lower windows were also securely fastened.</p>

<p>Ferral dropped down in a chair in the front hall and
drew his hand across his forehead.</p>

<p>"I'll be box-hauled if I can twig this layout, at all!"
he muttered. "Those fellows couldn't get out and leave
those doors and windows locked on the inside."</p>

<p>"And they couldn't have got past us on the stairs and
got out the way we came in," added Matt, equally nonplused.
"We looked carefully as we came down from
the upper floor, and the rascals must have been driven
ahead of us. I'm knocked all of a heap, and that's a
fact."</p>

<p>Carl cantered forward.</p>

<p>"Der shpooks vas blaying viggle-vaggle mit us," he
averred in a stage whisper. "Led us say goot-by, bards,
und shkin oudt. It vas pedder so, yah, so helup me."</p>

<p>"Are you getting cold feet, matey?" queried Ferral.</p>

<p>"I peen colt all ofer," admitted Carl, "efer since dot
shpook pubble vented off indo nodding righdt vile ve
look. Den der man-shpook meldet oudt, und dese oder
shpooks faded. Yah, you bed my life, ve vill go oop in
shmoke ourselufs oof ve shtay here long."</p>

<p>"Carl does a lot of foolish talking, Dick," spoke up
Matt, "but he's as game as a hornet, for all that. Don't
pay any attention to his spook talk. I saw a lantern in
the kitchen, and a padlock and key lying on a shelf.
While you two are trying to solve this riddle, I'm going
out to the barn and get a lock and key on the Red Flier.
I can't afford to let anything happen to that machine."</p>

<p>"I vill go mit you, Matt," said Carl.</p>

<p>"You stay here with Dick," Matt answered. "I'll not
be gone more than a minute."</p>

<p>Hurrying into the kitchen he lighted the lantern; then,
with the padlock and key in his pocket and the sword in
his hand, he unbolted the kitchen door and made his way
to the barn.</p>

<p>He listened intently as he went, but there was no
sound in the gloomy grove save the hooting of an owl.</p>

<p>He found the Red Flier just as he and Carl had left
it, and an examination of the barn proved that no one
had taken refuge there. After putting the bolt upon the
door and locking it&mdash;he already had the spark-plug in his
pocket&mdash;he felt easier, and returned unmolested to the
house.</p>

<p>While he was gone, Ferral and Carl had lighted a
large lamp in the parlor and drawn the shades at the
windows. They were seated comfortably in easy chairs,
eating sandwiches of dried beef and bread.</p>

<p>"There's your snack, mate," cried Ferral, pointing to
a plate on the table. "Better get on the outside of it.
We may have a lively time, and it's just as well to prepare
ourselves for whatever is going to happen."</p>

<p>Carl, now that the tension had eased a trifle and food
was in sight, was feeling better.</p>

<p>"I guess ve got der whole ranch py ourselufs," he
beamed, his mouth half-full of sandwich. "Ve schared
dem odder fellers avay. Oof dey shday avay undil ve
clear oudt, dot's all vat I ask."</p>

<p>"Who were the lubbers, and how did they slip their
cables?" queried Ferral. "That's the point that's got me
hooked. Do you think that white car, and that man we
saw in the road, had anything to do with the swabs who
were in here?"</p>

<p>Before Matt could answer, a rap fell on the front door
and its echoes ran through the house. Carl jumped up
in a panic.</p>

<p>"Blitzen and dunder!" he cried chokingly, struggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
with his last mouthful of sandwich and peering wildly
at Matt and Dick, "dere's somet'ing else! Schust ven
ve ged easy in our mindts, bang goes der front door!
Now vat?"</p>

<p>"We'll see what," returned Ferral grimly, getting to
his feet and starting for the hall.</p>

<p>Matt followed him, sword in hand, and ready for any
emergency that might present itself.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SERCOMB.</p>


<p>The rapping on the door had grown to a vigorous
thumping before Ferral and Matt reached the entrance.
Quickly throwing the bolt, Ferral pulled the door open
and a young man of twenty-one or two stepped in.</p>

<p>He was well built and muscular and had a smooth,
harmless face. The face was so void of expression that,
to Matt, it showed a lack of character.</p>

<p>Ferral was carrying the candle. Through its gleams,
he and the newcomer stared at each other.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why," murmured the youth who had just entered,
"can this be my cousin Dick?"</p>

<p>"You've taken my soundings all right, Sercomb,"
answered Ferral coolly. "Wasn't you expecting me?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, in a way," and Sercomb's eyes roamed to
Matt. "We got track of you down in Texas, and the
lawyer said he'd sent word, but we didn't know whether
you'd come or not."</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Sercomb?" and Matt saw Ferral's
keen eyes studying the other's face.</p>

<p>Sercomb met the look calmly.</p>

<p>"I've been spending the evening at a neighbor's," he
replied, "my nearest neighbor's&mdash;a mile away through
the hills."</p>

<p>"Got out of an up-stairs window, didn't you?" asked
Ferral caustically.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Sercomb, a slight
flush running into his face.</p>

<p>"Why, when you started to make that call you left
all the lower windows fastened and both outside doors
bolted on the inside."</p>

<p>"There's some mistake," answered Sercomb blankly.
"When I went away I left the front door open. We
don't go to the trouble of locking doors in this country,
Dick."</p>

<p>"Well, these were locked when I got here. What's
more, there were four men in a room up-stairs playing
cards. Come, come, you grampus! Don't try to play
fast and loose with me. How did you and the other
three lubbers get out of the house? And why wouldn't
you let me in when I rapped?"</p>

<p>"Look here," blustered Sercomb, "what do you take
me for? You never liked me, and you're up to your old
trick of suspecting me of something crooked whenever
anything goes wrong. I was hoping you'd got over that.
Uncle Jack was all cut up over the way you treated me,
and he never could understand it. Now that he's dead
and gone, I should think we might at least be friends."</p>

<p>"Dead and gone, is he," asked Ferral quickly. "How
do you know?"</p>

<p>"Because I've found him&mdash;and the will."</p>

<p>Ferral was dazed, as though some one had struck him
a blow in the face. Matt, who was watching Sercomb
intently, thought he saw an exultant flash in his eyes as
he spoke.</p>

<p>"The poor old chap," Sercomb went on, "was tucked
away in a thicket of bushes, less than a stone's throw
from the house. I don't know whether there was any
foul play&mdash;I haven't been able to find his Hindu servant,
Tippoo, yet, but there weren't any marks on the body.
I laid Uncle Jack away in the grove, and I'll show you
the place in the morning. The will was in his coat-pocket,
and wrapped in a piece of oilskin. It was very
sad, very sad," and Sercomb averted his face for a moment;
"and to think that neither you nor I, Dick, was
with him. But come into the other room. I'm tired and
want to sit down and rest."</p>

<p>Ferral, like one in a dream, followed his cousin into
the parlor. Sercomb was standing in front of Carl, apparently
wondering where Ferral had picked up so many
friends.</p>

<p>"Here, Ralph," said Ferral, suddenly rousing himself,
"I'd forgot to introduce my friends," and he presented
Matt and Carl. "What you've told me," he went on,
"catches me up short and leaves me in stays. I heard
that Uncle Jack had disappeared, but not that Davy Jones
had got him."</p>

<p>For the moment, Ferral's feelings caused him to thrust
aside his dislike of Sercomb.</p>

<p>"It's too confounded bad, and that's a fact," said Sercomb,
throwing himself into a chair and lighting a
cigarette. "I haven't been down to see the old chap for
six months. Our firm had a machine in the endurance
run from Chicago to Omaha, and I was busy with that,
and in getting ready for a big race that's soon to be
pulled off, so my hands were more than full. When I
got the lawyer's letter, though, I broke away from everything
and came on here."</p>

<p>"Why didn't the lawyer tell me Uncle Jack and the
will had been found?" asked Ferral.</p>

<p>"That only happened two days ago. The lawyer wrote
you the same time he wrote me."</p>

<p>"But I saw the lawyer in Lamy, day before yesterday&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He didn't know it, then."</p>

<p>"How does the will read, Ralph?"</p>

<p>"Everything was left to me, this place and all Uncle
Jack's holdings in South African stock. Of course, you
know, you've never come near him, Dick. If you had,
the will might have read different."</p>

<p>"I don't care the fag-end of nothing about Uncle Jack's
money; it was Uncle Jack himself I wanted to see. If
this place is yours, Sercomb&mdash;&mdash;" and Ferral broke off
and started to get up.</p>

<p>"You and your friends are welcome to stay here all
night," said Sercomb. "It's not much of a place, and
I'm going to pack up the valuables, send them to Denver,
and clear out."</p>

<p>"Going to keep up your racing?"</p>

<p>Sercomb smiled.</p>

<p>"Hardly; not with a mint of money like I've got now,"
he answered. "In a few months, I'm off for old
England."</p>

<p>A brief silence followed, broken suddenly by Sercomb.</p>

<p>"But I'm bothered about the intruders you say were
here when you came. They must have locked both doors
on the inside."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"A rum go," said Ferral, "if strangers can come in
and make free with a person's property like that."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it. This country is a good deal of a
wilderness, you know, and strangers are likely to do
anything."</p>

<p>Ferral said nothing concerning the phantom auto, nor
about the man who had so mysteriously vanished on the
cliff road; he confined himself strictly to what had happened
in the house, and tipped Matt and Carl a wink to
apprise them that they were to let it go at that.</p>

<p>Sercomb seemed greatly wrought up, and insisted on
taking a lamp and making an investigation of the upper
floor.</p>

<p>"They were thieves," Sercomb finally concluded.
"They thought I had gone away for the night, and so
they came in here and tore up Uncle Jack's bedroom like
we see it. It was known that Uncle Jack had money,
and it was just as well known that he had disappeared."</p>

<p>"If you knew all that yourself," said Ferral, "why
didn't you lock up before you went visiting?"</p>

<p>"I was careless," admitted Sercomb, with apparent
frankness. "The one thing that bothers me is the fact
that you were shot at, Dick! A nice way for you to be
treated in Uncle Jack's own house!"</p>

<p>"Don't let that fret you, Sercomb. I've had belaying-pins
and bullets heaved at me so many times that I don't
mind so long as they go wide. We'll have a round with
our jaw-tackle to-morrow. Just now, though, I and my
mates are ready for a little shut-eye. Where do we
berth?"</p>

<p>"Two of you can fix up Uncle Jack's bed and sleep
there; the other can bunk down on the couch in the
room where those four rascals were playing cards. I'll
sleep down-stairs on the parlor davenport. Yes," Sercomb
added, "it will be just as well to sleep over all this
queer business, and do our talking in the morning. Good
night, all of you."</p>

<p>Leaving the lamp for the boys, Sercomb went stumbling
down-stairs.</p>

<p>"What do you think of Ralph Sercomb, Matt?" whispered
Ferral, when Sercomb had left the stairs and could
be heard moving around the parlor.</p>

<p>"I don't like his looks," answered Matt frankly, "nor
the way he acts."</p>

<p>"Me, neider," put in Carl. "He vas a shly vone, und
I bed you he talks crooked mit himseluf."</p>

<p>"That's the way I always sized him up," admitted Ferral,
"and strikes me lucky if I think he's improved any
since I saw him last. But he's got the will, and poor old
Uncle Jack&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ferral's eyes wandered to the picture on the wall, and
he shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"I'd have a look at that will," said Matt, "and I'd get
a lawyer to look at it."</p>

<p>"These lawyer-sharps, of course, will have their watch
on deck, but I hate to quibble over the old chap's property
when it's Uncle Jack himself I wanted to find. Anyhow,
I got my whack, all right, to be cut off without a
shilling; at the same time, Ralph got more than was his
due. But I'm no kicker."</p>

<p>"If Sercomb drives a racing-car," went on Matt, "he
must have skill and nerve."</p>

<p>"Nerve, aye! Cousin Ralph always had his locker full
of that. But how shall we sleep? My head's all ahoo
with what's happened, and I need sleep to clear away
the fog. You and your mate take the bed, Matt, and
I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you don't," said Matt. "I'm for the couch in the
other room."</p>

<p>Matt insisted on this, and finally had his way. He was
not intending to sleep on the couch, but to go out to the
barn and spend the night in the tonneau of the Red Flier.
If Sercomb knew so much about automobiles, Matt felt
that the touring-car would bear watching. He had no
confidence in Sercomb, and felt sure that he was playing
an underhand game of some kind.</p>

<p>Sitting down on the couch, Matt waited until the house
was quiet, then went softly to the open window, climbed
through, and made his way to the ground by means of
the tree. Hardly had his feet struck solid earth, when
he heard the front door drawn carefully open.</p>

<p>Sercomb stepped out and noiselessly closed the door
behind him. Matt, intensely alive to the possibilities of
the unexpected situation, drew back into the darker
shadows of the tree-branches.</p>

<p>Sercomb, moving away a little from the house, gave
a low whistle. A hoot, as of an owl, came instantly
from the grove.</p>

<p>Sercomb started away rapidly in the direction from
which the sound came.</p>

<p>Matt followed him, keeping carefully in the shadows.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE PHANTOM AUTO AGAIN.</p>


<p>Sercomb did not follow the blind trail that led to the
main road. He made for the road, but took his way
along a foot-path that led through the grove.</p>

<p>It was not at all difficult for Matt to shadow him, and
the young motorist was considerably surprised to see
Sercomb gain the road at a point where a heavy touring-car
had drawn up. The car was about the size of the
Red Flier and, in the semidarkness, looked very much
like it. But it had a top.</p>

<p>Three men were standing near the head of the machine,
in the glow of the lamps. They were all fairly well
dressed, quite young, and there was little of the ruffian
about them.</p>

<p>They greeted Sercomb excitedly, and for several minutes
all four of them engaged in a brisk conversation.
Their voices were pitched in too low a tone, and Matt
was too far away to hear what was said.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, Matt reasoned, these three who had just
come in the automobile had formed part of the number
who had been in the up-stairs room. The fourth member
of the party must have been Sercomb, himself.</p>

<p>But how had Sercomb and the other three got away?
Their departure from the house was a mystery. And
where had they kept their automobile while they were in
the house? This was another mystery.</p>

<p>They were planning evil things of some sort, and
against Dick Ferral.</p>

<p>Matt had a clue. It assured him that Sercomb had
not told the truth when he said he knew nothing about
the so-called intruders who had vanished from the house
so strangely. Sercomb, by this stealthy meeting with the
three in the road, proved to Matt that he knew all about
the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>From their earnest talk it was clear that they were
plotting mischief. Wishing that he could overhear something
of what was said, Matt began creeping carefully
along the path. By getting a few yards nearer he was
sure that he would be within ear-shot.</p>

<p>Just as he had nearly reached the coveted point for
which he was making, and the mumble of talk was breaking
up into an occasional word which he could distinguish,
the conversation broke off with a chorus of excited
exclamations.</p>

<p>Matt started up, at first fearing he had been seen, and
that the four in the road were coming to capture him.
But in this he was mistaken. All four of them, as a
matter of fact, had started in his direction, but they
abruptly halted and whirled around. Matt's heart jumped
when he saw what it was that had claimed their attention.</p>

<p><i>It was the phantom auto!</i></p>

<p>The white runabout was wheeling swiftly along the
road in the direction of the treacherous cliff trail. The
streaming lights of the touring-car were full upon the
ghostly runabout, showing the vacant seats distinctly.
The weird spectacle was more than enough to fill the
four men with momentary panic. They stood as though
rooted to the ground, watching the runabout turn of its
own accord from the road, pass the touring-car, and then
come neatly back into the road again.</p>

<p>An oath broke from one of the men. Leaping to the
touring-car he cranked up the machine quickly and
hopped into the driver's seat. Two others jumped in
behind him, one in front and the other behind, Sercomb
being the only one who remained at the roadside.</p>

<p>Swiftly the touring-car was turned and headed in pursuit.
Then, suddenly, there came the report of a firearm,
shivering through the still air.</p>

<p>At first, Matt thought one of those in the touring-car
had fired at the runabout; then, a moment more, he knew
he was mistaken.</p>

<p>The shot had come from the runabout and had punctured
one of the touring-car's front tires.</p>

<p>The big car limped and slewed until the power was cut
off and it came to a halt. Those who were in the car
piled out, sputtering and fuming, and Sercomb ran forward
and joined them. Together, all four watched the
white phantom whisk out of sight.</p>

<p>There followed a good deal of talking and gesticulating
among Sercomb and the three with him. Finally one
of them took off the tail lamp and all made an examination
of the damaged tire.</p>

<p>A jack was got out and the forward wheel lifted.</p>

<p>From his actions, Sercomb was nervous and excited.
He kept walking from the road, looking toward the house
and listening. He fancied, no doubt, just as Matt did,
that the sound of the shot might have awakened the
sleepers in the house.</p>

<p>However, this did not seem to have been the case.</p>

<p>Leaving one of the men to tinker with the tire, Sercomb
took the other two and led them off through the
grove. They passed within a yard of where Matt was
crouching in the bushes, but their plans, whatever they
were, had been settled, and they were doing no talking.</p>

<p>Matt continued to dodge after Sercomb. The course
he and the two with him were taking did not lead toward
the house, but angled off through the grove on a line
that would take them fully a hundred feet past the nearest
wall of the adobe building.</p>

<p>Abreast of the house, at that point, there was a circular
space, clear of timber and with only a patch of
brush in the center. Matt, not daring to venture beyond
the edge of the timber, stood and watched while Sercomb
and his companions disappeared in the thicket.</p>

<p>Matt's position was such that he could see all around
the little patch of bushes, and he watched for the three
men to appear on the other side. They did not appear,
and as minute after minute slipped away, Matt's amazement
and curiosity increased.</p>

<p>The men had gone into that little thicket, and why had
they not shown themselves again? What was there in
that bunch of brush to attract them and keep them so
long?</p>

<p>Matt concluded to investigate. There might be danger
in doing that, as there would be three against him if he
was discovered, but he knew he had only to raise his
voice to bring Ferral and Carl.</p>

<p>This clue, which he had picked up so unexpectedly in
the night, called upon him to make the most of it and, if
possible, discover what Sercomb was up to.</p>

<p>Hastening across the cleared space, he came to the
thicket without a challenge. Resolutely he plunged into
the bushes&mdash;and the next moment the ground seemed to
drop out from under him.</p>

<p>Throwing out his hands wildly he plunged downward,
struck an incline and rolled over and over, finally coming
to a jolting stop on hard earth, on his hands and
knees.</p>

<p>The suddenness of his fall had bewildered him. He
was bruised a little, but not otherwise hurt, and as his
wits returned his curiosity came uppermost.</p>

<p>What sort of a place was he in?</p>

<p>His groping hands informed him that the incline he
had rolled down was a rude stairway. A patch of starlight
above revealed the opening into which he had stumbled.</p>

<p>Climbing the stairway, he reached a stone landing and
lifted himself erect in the very center of the thicket. A
flat slab, tilted upon its edge, showed how the hole was
covered when not in use.</p>

<p>Matt drew a quick breath. The mysteries of La Vita
Place were clearing a little.</p>

<p>Here, undoubtedly, was a passage communicating with
the house. Sercomb and the other three men must have
used it in making their strange escape from the up-stairs
room, earlier in the night.</p>

<p>But why were Sercomb and his two companions going
back through the passage?</p>

<p>Instinctively Matt's suspicions flew to Dick Ferral.
Sercomb was planning some evil against him, and the
two from the touring-car were there to help him carry
it out.</p>

<p>Matt hesitated a moment, trying to decide whether he
should go through the passage or reach the house by
crossing the cleared place and entering the front door.</p>

<p>He decided upon the passage. The rascals had gone
that way and would probably make their escape in the
same manner.</p>

<p>Hurrying down the steps he began making his way
along a gallery. The passage was not wide, for he could
stretch out his hands and touch either side. It ran
straight, and Matt pushed rapidly through the gloom,
trailing a hand along one wall.</p>

<p>He knew he had only a hundred feet to go before he
should reach the house, but in his haste he covered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
distance before he realized it, and stumbled against a
flight of steps.</p>

<p>While he was picking himself up, he heard a commotion
from somewhere above&mdash;a wild scramble of feet, a
thump of blows and an overturning of furniture. Above
the hubbub sounded the voice of Carl.</p>

<p>"Vat's der madder mit you? Hoop-a-la! Take dot,
oof you like or oof you don'd like, und dere's anoder!
Matt! Come along for der fight <i>fest</i>! Vere you vas,
Matt, vile der scrimmage iss going on! Verral! Iss dot
you?"</p>

<p>Just then, as Matt began scrambling upward, a form
came hurtling down.</p>

<p>"They're onto us, Joe!" panted a voice. "This way,
old pal! Nothing doing to-night. Cut for it! I ran
into something at the foot of the steps&mdash;look out for
that!"</p>

<p>Matt, who had been thrown violently against the wall,
heard forms dashing past him. Before he could interfere
with them, they were well along the passage.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SURROUNDED BY ENEMIES.</p>


<p>Although the two men had got past Matt, nevertheless
he followed them to the end of the passage, arriving
just in time to see them disappear through the opening
and close the aperture with the slab.</p>

<p>Only two went out. What had become of Sercomb?
Had Ferral and Carl captured him&mdash;catching him red-handed
and so unmasking his treachery?</p>

<p>In any event, Ferral and Carl had proven more than
a match for the two miscreants who had stolen in upon
them. Thankful that the affair had turned out so fortunately
for his friends, although still mystified as to what
Sercomb's purpose was, Matt groped his way back along
the corridor and mounted the steps.</p>

<p>It was a long flight&mdash;much longer than the one at the
other end of the passage&mdash;and, at the top, Matt was confronted
by a blank wall. He ran his hands over it, and,
in so doing, must have touched a spring, for a section of
the wall slid back and a sudden glow of lamplight blinded
him.</p>

<p>"Ach, du lieber!" came the astounded voice of Carl.
"Dere vas Matt, py chincher! Vere you come from,
hey?"</p>

<p>Matt stepped from the head of the steps into the room
in which Ferral and Carl had been sleeping. The panel
closed noiselessly behind him.</p>

<p>"Sink me!" muttered Ferral, stepping past Matt to
run his hands over the wall. "A nice little trap-door in
the wall, or I'm a Fiji!" He whirled around. "How
does it come you stepped through it, messmate?"</p>

<p>"Where's Sercomb?" whispered Matt, peering around.</p>

<p>"What's he got to do with this?"</p>

<p>Just at that moment Sercomb's voice came up from
below.</p>

<p>"What's going on up there? Anything happened,
Dick?"</p>

<p>"Two men came in and made trouble for us!" shouted
Matt. "Didn't you hear 'em run down the stairs?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't hear anybody!" answered Sercomb.</p>

<p>"Take a look around, and we'll see what we can find
up here."</p>

<p>During this brief colloquy, Ferral and Carl were staring
at Matt in open-mouthed astonishment.</p>

<p>Matt whirled to Ferral.</p>

<p>"Not a word to Sercomb about that hole in the wall,"
he whispered. "Tell me quick, what happened in here?"</p>

<p>"I was sleeping full and by, forty knots," answered
Ferral, in the same low tone, "when I felt myself grabbed.
It was dark as Egypt, and I couldn't see a thing. I
shouted to Carl, and we had it touch and go, here in the
dark. My eye, but it was a scrimmage! Right in the
midst of it the fellows we were fighting melted away. I
had just got the glim to going when you stepped in
on us."</p>

<p>"Wasn't Sercomb in the fight?"</p>

<p>"Why, no. He must have been down-stairs, sleeping
like a log. He only just chirped&mdash;you heard him."</p>

<p>"Well, Sercomb came into this room with two other
men, through that hole in the wall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that right?" demanded Ferral, his face hardening.</p>

<p>"Yes, but don't say a word about it. Wait till we find
out what his game is."</p>

<p>"How dit you know all dot, Matt?" queried Carl.</p>

<p>Briefly as he could Matt sketched his recent experiences.
The astonishing recital left his two friends gasping.</p>

<p>"The old hunks!" breathed Ferral, scowling. "I can
smoke his weather-roll, fast enough. What did I tell
you about the soft-sawdering beggar?"</p>

<p>Matt stepped into the hall and listened. Apparently,
Sercomb was not in the house. Coming back, he pulled
his two friends close together so they could hear him
without his speaking above a whisper.</p>

<p>"Sercomb has gone out to hurry up the repairs on the
big car and get it out of the way. We can talk a little,
but we've got to be wary. Don't let Sercomb know anything
about this clue I've picked up. We're surrounded
by enemies, Ferral, and you're the object of some sort of
game they've got on. By lying low, perhaps we can get
wise to it."</p>

<p>"Dot shpook auto has dook a hant in der pitzness,"
murmured Carl, flashing a fearful glance around. "I
don'd like dot fery goot."</p>

<p>"This spook business will all be explained, Carl," said
Matt, "and you'll find that flesh and blood is mixed up
in the whole of it. That white runabout put a shot into
one of the tires of that big touring-car, and no revolver
ever went off without a human hand back of it. We
know, too, how those men got away from that room
where they were playing cards. They ran in here, got
through the hole in the wall and went out by way of the
tunnel. That shot that was fired at you, Dick, and put
out the lamp, must have come from this room, just before
Sercomb and the others dodged through the wall."</p>

<p>"Sercomb?" echoed Ferral.</p>

<p>"Sure! It's a cinch he was playing cards in that room
with the three men. He came here from Denver, and he
must have traveled in that big car and brought the others
with him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's the nice boy!" commented Ferral sarcastically.
"A fine cousin, that swab is! That phantom
flugee is mixing in the game. I wonder if Sercomb has
anything to do with that?"</p>

<p>"No. When the phantom auto showed up in the road,
Sercomb and all three of the others were scared nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
out of their wits. I'll bet that was the first time Sercomb
ever saw it. Besides, the bullet that pierced the tire of
the big car came from the runabout. That wouldn't have
happened if the runabout was here to help Sercomb's
plans."</p>

<p>"Right-o. What kind of a bally old place is this, anyhow?
Holes in the wall, tunnels, and all that&mdash;it fair
dazes me. What could Uncle Jack have wanted of a
secret passage?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you tell me that this was an old Mexican house,
and that your uncle bought it?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"That's how he got hold of the place, matey."</p>

<p>"Then it must have come into his hands like we find
it. The Mexicans used to build queer houses; I found
that out while I was down in Ph&oelig;nix."</p>

<p>Matt turned away and took a look at the walls. They
were wainscoted in cedar, all around. Every little way
there were panels, and the entrance to the passage, which
Matt had recently used, was by a panel.</p>

<p>"The walls of these adobe houses are always thick,"
went on Matt, "but these walls are even thicker than
common. There's room in this wall for that stairway,
and no one would ever suspect the wall is hollow, simply
because it's made of adobe."</p>

<p>"How does the door work?" queried Ferral, stepping
to the wainscoting and trying to manipulate the panel.
"I'd like to know how to get the cover off the blooming
hatch; the knowledge might come handy."</p>

<p>Along the wainscoting, about five feet from the floor,
were arranged clothes-hooks. Matt, helping Ferral hunt
for the secret spring that operated the panel, pulled on
one of the hooks. Instantly the panel slid open, answering
the pull on the hook with weird silence.</p>

<p>"Chiminy grickets!" murmured Carl, stepping back.
"Dot looks like der vay to der infernal blace."</p>

<p>Ferral stepped forward as though he would pass
through the opening, but Matt caught his arm and held
him back.</p>

<p>"Don't go down there now, Ferral," said he. "When
Sercomb comes we want him to find us here. He doesn't
guess that I'm next to what he's done to-night, and none
of his confederates know it. If we keep mum, the
knowledge may do us a lot of good. If we try to face
him down with it, we'll only show him our hands without
accomplishing anything."</p>

<p>"The sneaking lubber!" growled Ferral. "Why, he
berthed us in this room so he and his mates could sneak
in on us while we were asleep. But," and here Ferral
rubbed his chin perplexedly, "what did they want to do
that for?"</p>

<p>"We'll find out," returned Matt, "if we play our cards
right."</p>

<p>"You're the lad to discover things," said Ferral admiringly.
"I never had a notion you were going to slip
out of the house when you left us."</p>

<p>"And I never had a notion what I was going to drop
into," said Matt, "I can promise you that. But it is a
tip-top clue, and we'll be foolish if we don't use it for
all it's worth."</p>

<p>"You've started off in handsome style! Your head-work
makes me feel like a green hand and a lubber."</p>

<p>"Dot's Matt, Verral," declared Carl, puffing up like a
turkey-cock. "He alvays does t'ings in hantsome shdyle,
you bed you. He iss der lucky feller to tie to, dot's
righdt. I know, pecause I haf tied to him meinseluf, und
I haf peen hafing luck righdt along efer since, yah, so.
Be jeerful, eferypody, und oof der shpooks leaf us alone,
ve vill all come oudt oof der horn py der pig end. But
vat makes Sercomb act like dot?"</p>

<p>"He wants Uncle Jack's property," scowled Ferral,
"and I'll wager that's what he's working for."</p>

<p>"But how can he be working for it when he's already
got it?" put in Matt. "He claims to have found your
uncle, and to have secured the will."</p>

<p>"That's his speak-easy for it. He's a long-winded
grampus, and can talk the length of the best bower, but
that don't mean that there's any truth in all his wig-wagging."</p>

<p>"Now you're hitting the high gear without any lost
motion," said Matt. "Between you and me and the
spark-plug, Dick, I don't think he ever found your uncle;
and, as for the will, if he really has it, and everything's
left to him, what's all this underhand work for?"</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to Ferral.</p>

<p>"Say," he whispered hoarsely, "do you think that
sneaking cur could have handed out any foul play to
Uncle Jack? I hate to think it of him, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," answered Matt gravely, "I don't think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by some one coming in at the front
door, and stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"There's Sercomb now," he whispered. "Let's hear
what he's got to say for himself. Mind you don't let
out anything about my clue. When you had your trouble,
I ran in here from the other room and lent a hand."</p>

<p>"Are you up there?" came Sercomb's voice. "I can't
find a soul about the place."</p>

<p>From the road the boys could hear the muffled pounding
of a motor. And they knew, even as Sercomb spoke,

<p class="chaptitle">THE KETTLE CONTINUES TO BOIL.</p>


<p>Sercomb came up-stairs and stepped into the room.
Daylight was just coming in through the windows, and
the gray of the morning and the yellow of the lamplight
gave Sercomb's face a ghastly look. Nevertheless,
it was a frank and open face&mdash;as always.</p>

<p>"Now, Dick," cried Sercomb, "what in the world has
been going on here? Do you mean to say that some one
came into this room and attacked you?"</p>

<p>"That's the how of it, old ship," answered Ferral, repressing
his real feelings admirably. "As near as we
can figure out, there were two of them. It was so dark,
though, we couldn't see our own fists, so there may have
been more than two."</p>

<p>"Some of the gang who dropped in here while I was
away, I'll bet," said Sercomb.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking the same thing, Ralph," returned Ferral,
with a meaning look at Matt. "They were handy,
too, but not handy enough. They left us all at once,
and how they ever did it beats me. We boxed the compass
for 'em, though, and when we'd worked around the
card they thought they had enough&mdash;and ducked."</p>

<p>"Where did they go?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear them go out the front door?"</p>

<p>"Not I, Dick! If I had, I'd have taken a part in the
scrimmage myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were slow hearing the racket, Ralph. It was all
over when you piped up."</p>

<p>"I heard it quick enough, but I was sound asleep when
it aroused me. Being a little bewildered, I went out into
the kitchen."</p>

<p>Something like loathing swept over Matt as he watched
Sercomb's face and listened to his smooth misstatement.</p>

<p>"Wonder how Uncle Jack managed to hang on in such
a lawless country as this," said Ferral.</p>

<p>"No one ever bothered him. He was pretty well liked
by the scattered settlers."</p>

<p>"Everybody liked the old chap! I thought no end of
him myself."</p>

<p>"Too bad you didn't show it, Dick, while he was alive,"
said Sercomb.</p>

<p>There wasn't any sarcasm in his voice&mdash;only a dry,
expressionless statement of what Ferral knew were the
cold facts. Nevertheless, there was a gratuitous slur
in the words. Ferral bristled at once, but a look from
Matt caused him to curb his temper.</p>

<p>"Belay a bit on that, Ralph," said Ferral mildly. "I
know it well without your say-so to round it off. From
now on, though, I'll do my best to show Uncle Jack what
I think of him."</p>

<p>Sercomb looked a little puzzled.</p>

<p>"His will shows everybody what he thought of you&mdash;at
the last," said he.</p>

<p>It looked as though Sercomb was deliberately trying
to force a quarrel, but Ferral, still with Matt's glances
to admonish him, did not fall into the trap.</p>

<p>"I'll go down and get breakfast," observed Sercomb,
after waiting in vain for a response from Ferral. "Some
Denver friends are coming up from Lamy to make me
a little visit, and we may be a bit crowded here. There
are three of them."</p>

<p>It was a broad hint for Dick Ferral to take his two
friends and leave, as soon after breakfast as he could
make it convenient. Ferral fired up at that. Matt and
Carl had served him well, and he was not the one to put
up with any back-handed slaps from his cousin Ralph.</p>

<p>"By the seven holy spiritsails, Sercomb!" he cried,
"I'll have you know that I and my friends have as much
right under Uncle Jack's roof as you and yours. We'll
be here to breakfast, and as long as we want to stay."</p>

<p>"Now, don't fly off at a tangent, Dick," returned Sercomb,
with a distressed look. "I didn't mean anything
like that, and why do you go out of your way to take
me in any such fashion? I'll go down and get the
meal for all of us&mdash;if you can put up with my cooking."</p>

<p>"Go and help, Carl," said Matt. "We don't want to
make Mr. Sercomb any extra trouble. We won't be here
very long, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Dot's me," said Carl, as cheerfully as he could.</p>

<p>He hated to be associated with Sercomb, but the idea
of a meal always struck a mellow note in Carl's get-up.</p>

<p>"You understand, don't you, Mr. King?" said Sercomb,
in a whining tone, turning to Matt and jerking
his head toward Ferral.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," smiled Matt.</p>

<p>Carl and Sercomb went out. When they were going
down the stairs Ferral shook his fist.</p>

<p>"Shamming the griffin!" he growled; "the putty-faced
shark, I'd like to lay him on his beam-ends! Do you
wonder I've had a grouch at him all these years, Matt?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Matt frankly; "but stick it out.
I've a hunch, Dick, that you're soon going to be done
with your cousin for good and all. He's playing a game
here that's going to get him into hot water."</p>

<p>Matt stretched himself out on the bed.</p>

<p>"I'm going to lie here," said he, "and you can talk
to me. Carl will keep an eye on Sercomb. Tell me
more about your uncle."</p>

<p>"He was no end of a toff in London," replied Ferral,
taking a chair and casting a look at the portrait. "His
wife died, and that broke him up; then his daughter died,
and that was about the finish. He bucked up, though,
and crossed the pond. When he was in Hamilton he
said he wanted to go some place where there wasn't so
many people. Then he came here."</p>

<p>"This last move of his," said Matt, "looks like a strange
one to me."</p>

<p>"He was full of his crochets, Uncle Jack was, but there
was always a good bit of sense down at the bottom of
them. Sercomb would have gone down on his knees and
licked his boots, knowing Uncle Jack had money, and
nobody but him and me to leave it to. There's another
cut to my jib, though. I wouldn't go around where he
was because I was afraid he'd think the same of me. I've
got a notion, Matt, and it just came to me."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet that, when Uncle Jack left, he hid that will,
and that he signed it and left blank the place where his
heir's name was to be. The one that was shrewd enough
to find it, you know, could put in his own name."</p>

<p>"Why should he do that?"</p>

<p>"Just to see whether Sercomb or I was the smarter."</p>

<p>"But you overlook what your uncle said about being
found wherever the will was discovered."</p>

<p>"Right-o. I'm always overlooking things. You see,
I'm taken all aback with this game of Sercomb's. If I
knew what his lay was, or what he's trying to accomplish,
I'd have my turn-to in short order. Still, as you
say, he's going to get his what-for no matter which way
the wind blows."</p>

<p>"There's a lot of things happened that are mighty
mysterious," mused Matt; "little by little, though, they're
clearing up. That clue I hooked onto last night makes
several things clear. Did Sercomb know you were coming?"</p>

<p>"The Lamy lawyer must have told him he'd found
out where I was, and had written to me. One thing
I did do, and that was to sling my fist to a letter for
Uncle Jack, once a month, anyhow. So he knew I was
down in the Panhandle."</p>

<p>"When you pounded on the door last night, Sercomb
must have suspected it was you. If he hadn't, he'd have
let you in."</p>

<p>"He'd have let me in anyhow, only he didn't want me
to see those other three swabs. And then for him to
play-off like he did, and say he was calling at a neighbor's!
It would have done me a lot of good to blow
the gaff, when he came in on us a spell ago, and let him
understand just where he gets off."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't have helped any, and it might have
spoiled our chances for finding out what he's up to."</p>

<p>What answer Ferral made to this Matt did not hear.
The young motorist had put in a strenuous night, and
he was worn out. Ferral's words died to a mumble, and
before Matt knew it he was sound asleep.</p>

<p>Some one shook him, and he opened his eyes and
started up.</p>

<p>"Dozed off, did I?" he laughed. "Sorry, old man, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
I didn't sleep any last night, you know. You were saying&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>An odor of boiling coffee and sizzling bacon floated up
from down-stairs.</p>

<p>"What I was saying, mate," answered Ferral, "was
some sort of a while ago. I've had my jaw-tackle stowed
for an hour, letting you do the shut-eye trick. But now
it's about mess-time, I reckon; and, anyhow, those friends
of Sercomb's are here from Lamy. Listen!"</p>

<p>The chug of a motor on the low gear came to Matt.
Getting up, he looked out of a window that commanded
the front of the house.</p>

<p>A car was coming slowly along the blind trail from
the road, following the same course the Red Flier had
taken the night before.</p>

<p>As the automobile drew closer, Matt gave a startled
exclamation.</p>

<p>"Some new kink in the yarn, Matt?" queried Ferral.</p>

<p>"I should say so!" answered Matt. "That's the same
car that was in the road last night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" demanded Ferral, grabbing Matt's arm.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt of it, Dick," said Matt; "and the
three in the car are the same ones Sercomb met and
talked with. Two of them, of course, are the handy-boys
who blew in here and roughed things up with you
and Carl."</p>

<p>The car came to a stop in front. Just then the front
door opened and Sercomb rushed out.</p>

<p>"Hello, fellows!" he called. "Mighty glad to see you.
Pile out and clean up for the grub-pile&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt heard that much, and just then had to turn around
to look after Ferral. With an angry growl, Ferral had
broken away and started down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Dick!" called Matt, running after him.</p>

<p>But Ferral gave no heed to the call. He was down
the stairs and out of the door like a shot. Matt was
close on his heels, but he was not close enough to keep
him from trouble.</p>

<p>"You two-faced crimp!" Matt heard him yell. "You'll
down me in Lamy and take my money, will you, and then
show up here! Now, strike me lucky if I don't play
evens!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ORDERED AWAY.</p>


<p>Matt remembered at once what Ferral had said about
having been robbed while on his way to La Vita Place.
Now that Ferral had recognized one of the newcomers
as the man who had made the treacherous assault on him,
a new light was thrown on that Lamy robbery. If the
thief was one of Sercomb's friends, it looked as though
Sercomb must have had a guilty knowledge of the affair&mdash;perhaps
had planned it.</p>

<p>Matt attempted to grab Ferral and pull him away,
but Sercomb and the other two got ahead of him. The
three laid hold of Ferral so roughly that Matt immediately
gave them his attention.</p>

<p>"Let up on that!" he cried, catching Sercomb and
jerking him away just as he was about to strike Ferral
with his clenched fist. "There's no need of pounding
Dick."</p>

<p>"I'll pound <i>you</i> if you give me any of your lip!" answered
Sercomb.</p>

<p>"The latch-string's out," answered Matt grimly. "Walk
in."</p>

<p>At that moment Carl rolled out of the door.</p>

<p>"Vat's der rooction?" he tuned up, his eyes dancing
over the squabble.</p>

<p>Carl was always as ready to fight as he was to eat,
which is saying a good deal.</p>

<p>"Help me get Ferral away from that fellow, Carl,"
called Matt.</p>

<p>"On der chump!"</p>

<p>Carl landed right in the midst of the struggle, and in
about half a minute he and Matt had separated Ferral
from his antagonist. With a neat crack, straight from
the shoulder, Matt disarmed a fellow who had jerked a
wrench out of the automobile. This put the last finishing
touch to the clash, and both sides drew apart, bunching
together, and each panting and glaring at the other.</p>

<p>"Dere iss only vone t'ing vat I can do on a embty
shtomach, und dot's fighdt," wheezed Carl, slapping his
arms. "It don'd vas ofer so kevick? I got a pooty leedle
kitney-punch vat I vould like to hant aroundt, only I
don'd haf der dime."</p>

<p>"Take off your grappling-hooks, Matt," puffed Ferral,
squirming to get out from under Matt's hands.
"Dowse me if I've taken that crimp's full measure, yet.
The nerve of him, breezing right up here with my money
in his clothes!"</p>

<p>"Steady!" said Matt, closing down harder on Ferral
and easily holding him. "This has gone far enough."</p>

<p>"I should say it had," spoke up Sercomb, showing a
flash of temper. "Pretty way for my friends to be
treated! I won't stand for it."</p>

<p>"When you've got thieves for friends, Sercomb," cried
Ferral, "you're liable to have to stand for a good deal!"</p>

<p>"Hand him one for that, Joe!" urged one of the newcomers.
"That's the first time I ever heard a thing like
that batted up to Joe Mings, and him not raising so
much as a finger against the man that said it."</p>

<p>"We've got to think of Ralph, Harry," said Joe Mings.
"This row makes it uncomfortable for him."</p>

<p>"Especially since the chap that's making such a holy
show of himself is my own cousin," remarked Sercomb,
with bitter reproach.</p>

<p>"The more shame to you," flared Ferral, "to let the
hound that robbed your own cousin come here like he's
done, and take his part. Keep your offing, Joe Mings,"
he added, to the thief, "or I'll tie you into a granny's
knot and heave you clean over your devil-wagon!
Where's that money? I need it, and I'm going to have
it."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," answered
Mings. "You must be dippy! Why, I never saw you
before until you rushed out and tried to climb my neck."</p>

<p>"You two-tongued swab! Do you mean to stand up
there and say you didn't meet me in Lamy, tell me you
were a Canadian in distress, and ask me to go to your
boarding-house with you and square a bill with your
landlady? And will you say you didn't land on me with
a pair of knuckle-dusters in a dark street and run off
with my roll?"</p>

<p>"That's a pipe," asserted Joe Mings. "Somebody's
doped you."</p>

<p>"Enough of this, Dick," said Sercomb. "Joe's a friend
of mine. All these lads are friends, and all of them
drivers of speed-cars. They're here by my invitation.
As for you, you're not here by anybody's invitation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Except Uncle Jack's," interposed Ferral grimly.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jack has cashed in, and he's not to be counted.
This ranch belongs to me, and you and your ruffianly
friends will leave it. Your friends can't ever come back
here&mdash;and neither can you until you learn how to behave.
Come on in, boys," he added to the others. "Grub's on
the table."</p>

<p>"Avast a minute!" called Ferral. "I'm ready to trip
anchor and slant away&mdash;having never liked you so you
could notice, and liking you less than ever after this
round&mdash;but I and my mates will have our chuck before
we go. What's more, that shark will hand over my
funds, or I'll come back here with an officer and make
him more trouble than he can get out of."</p>

<p>"He hasn't got your money," said Sercomb, "so he
can't turn it over. What's more, you'll dust out of here
<i>now</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I will!" Ferral lurched for the door, and Matt
and Carl followed him. "You may have right and title
to this bally old dugout, Sercomb, but you'll have a
chance to show me that in court; and Uncle Jack may
be dead and gone, but that's something I'll find out for
myself, and make good and sure of it, at that. His
money don't bother me, for I've my two hands and know
the ropes of a trade, so I won't starve; but it's Uncle
Jack himself I'm thinking of. As for you, you were always
a mixture of bear, bandicoot, and crocodile, and I
wouldn't trust you the length of a cable. I and my mates
are going in and eat, and if you want to avoid a smash,
don't cross our hawser while we're doing it."</p>

<p>He turned from the door, and, followed by Matt and
Carl, went into the sitting-room, where the table had
been spread.</p>

<p>"Now we've got Sercomb's signals," said Ferral, dropping
into a chair at the table, "and know where we all
stand. What do you think of this new twist in the game,
Matt?"</p>

<p>"Too bad it happened," answered Matt, as he and Carl
likewise seated themselves. "We were just getting
squared away to find out something worth while, Dick."</p>

<p>"I couldn't hold myself in, that's all. The idea of
Sercomb having that crimp in tow! I'm a Fiji if I don't
think my dear cousin put up that Lamy job with Mings."</p>

<p>"I'd thought of that, too. But why should he do it?"</p>

<p>"To knock the bottom out of my ditty-bag and keep
me away from La Vita Place. More belike, he'd a notion
Mings would land me in a sick-bay. You remember
Uncle Jack's room was all torn up when we first saw
it?"</p>

<p>Matt nodded.</p>

<p>"Why was that?" Ferral went on. "Carpet torn away,
sea-chest dumped all over the floor, everything in a
raffle. Why was that?"</p>

<p>"What do you think was the cause of it?"</p>

<p>Ferral leaned across the table.</p>

<p>"Sercomb had been looking for Uncle Jack's will!"
he declared. "He never found Uncle Jack, and he never
found the will. If he's got a piece of paper, it's one he's
fixed up for himself."</p>

<p>"Mighty serious talk, old chap," said Matt gravely,
"but I've a hunch you've got the right end of it, at that.
But for this row, we might have been on fairly good
terms with Sercomb, and have used our knowledge, in a
quiet way, to discover what he's trying to do."</p>

<p>"Vell," remarked Carl, "he has rushed dot gang in
here, und dot makes four to dree. Meppy id vas pedder
ve don'd shday. Aber I'd like to hang on, you bed you!
Sooch a chance for some fighding I nefer foundt yet."</p>

<p>Then followed a brief interval of silence, during which
the boys gave their whole attention to their food. Ferral
was first to speak.</p>

<p>"You were going to set sail for Santa Fé this morning,
Matt."</p>

<p>"We could never pull out and leave you in this mess,"
answered Matt. "Mr. Tomlinson has given us plenty of
time to get to Santa Fé."</p>

<p>"Sure, ve shday undil you vas pedder fixed to be jeerful,
Verral," put in Carl. "Dot's der greadt t'ing in
life, my poy, alvays to make some shmiles, no madder
vich vay chumps der cat, und be jeerful."</p>

<p>"You're a pair of mates worth having," averred Ferral,
with feeling. "I don't know what I'd have done if
it hadn't been for you. The very first thing you haul
me off a cliff wall. If you hadn't done that, by now
Sercomb would be having the run of the ship. I'll do
something for you some time, even if I have to travel
around the world to do it. Just now, though, I'd like
to know what's become of Tippoo, Uncle Jack's <i>kitmagar</i>
and <i>khansa-man</i>."</p>

<p>"Vat's dose?" inquired Carl.</p>

<p>"The Hindu foot-servant and steward," explained Ferral.
"Uncle Jack was in India for a while, and that's
where he picked up Tippoo. Sercomb, when we first met
him here, hinted that Tippoo may have handed Uncle
Jack his come-up-with, but that was unjust. Tippoo
would lay down his life for Uncle Jack, and has been
devoted to him for years."</p>

<p>A noise from the barn reached those in the sitting-room.
A window of the room commanded a view of the
barn. Matt, suddenly looking through the window, uttered
an exclamation, sprang up, grabbed his hat, and
rushed through the kitchen and out of the house.</p>

<p>"What's the bloming racket now?" cried Ferral, likewise
getting to his feet.</p>

<p>"Look vonce!" answered Carl, pointing through the
window. "Dere iss a shance for more scrimmages! Led
us fly some kites so ve don'd lose nodding oof der seddo."</p>

<p>Through the window Ferral could see that the barn
doors had been broken open, and that Sercomb and
his three companions were around the Red Flier.</p>

<p>Knowing Matt's concern on account of the machine,
Ferral lost not a moment in running through the kitchen
and following Matt and Carl.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A NEW PLAN.</p>


<p>"Get away from that machine!" cried Matt, leaping
into the barn.</p>

<p>He had grabbed up a club on the way, and as he spoke
he advanced threateningly upon Sercomb and his friends.</p>

<p>All four were in the car or around it. What they
were trying to do Matt did not know, but he felt pretty
sure they had not broken into the barn with harmless
intentions concerning the Red Flier.</p>

<p>Sercomb turned away from the front of the machine
and the others got out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you intending to do with that club?" Sercomb
demanded.</p>

<p>"That depends on what you're trying to do to that
car," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"This is my property and the car has no business here.
We want this place for the other machine."</p>

<p>"Then leave the barn and I'll run the machine out. I
don't allow any one to fool with that car."</p>

<p>"There ain't one of us," struck in Mings, "that don't
know more about a car in a minute than you do in a
year."</p>

<p>"That may be," said Matt, "but I'm boss of the Red
Flier, all the same."</p>

<p>"I've heard about you, King," went on Mings. "Dace
Perry, of Denver, is a friend of mine, and he told me
just what kind of a four-flusher you are&mdash;always sticking
your nose into other people's business, same as now."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear Perry has a friend," returned Matt
amiably, "but he could have told you a whole lot that I
guess he thought he hadn't better."</p>

<p>Just then Carl and Ferral flocked into the barn.</p>

<p>"Are they trying to scuttle that red craft, Matt?" asked
Ferral.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply, "they're just going to run it out
of the barn to make room for the other car. I told them
I'd attend to it."</p>

<p>"And when you get the car out of the barn," said Sercomb
pointedly, "just keep going, all of you."</p>

<p>"We'll do that to the king's taste," averred Ferral.
"I wouldn't hang around here with you and your outfit
for a bushel of sovs, Sercomb, although I'm coming back
after my roll."</p>

<p>"Come on, fellows," called Sercomb, and left the barn
with his friends at his heels.</p>

<p>Matt got the Red Flier in shape, Carl climbed into the
tonneau and Ferral into the front seat, and they moved
out of the barn.</p>

<p>As they passed around the house they saw Mings sitting
in the other car, evidently watching it to make sure
it would not be tampered with. He scowled at the Red
Flier as it passed.</p>

<p>"Dey like us a heap&mdash;I don'd t'ink," chuckled Carl.
"I bed you dot Mings feller iss vone oof der chumps vat
come indo der room lasht nighdt, Verral."</p>

<p>"He don't like me any too well," said Ferral grimly.
"And he's none too easy in his mind, either. He knows
what I can do to him for that Lamy business."</p>

<p>"Are you really going to get an officer in Lamy and
come back here?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Strike me lucky if I'm not!"</p>

<p>Reaching the main road, Matt turned in the direction
of Lamy and the cliffs.</p>

<p>"We'll take you to Lamy," said Matt, "and bring the
officer back. We've the whole day before us, though,
and there's something else I'd like to do."</p>

<p>"Name it, mate. I'm in for anything."</p>

<p>"I'd like to go along the top of those cliffs and see
if I can find how and where that white runabout went to
last night."</p>

<p>"If you go along the cliffs, you'll have to walk. Why
not make your examination from the road?"</p>

<p>"We can't see enough from the road, Dick. There
may be something on the other side of that ridge. By
walking, and staying on the cliffs, we can see both sides.
The mystery of that white auto may be the key to the
whole affair at La Vita Place. Now's the time to settle
it. If we don't, Sercomb and those other fellows will."</p>

<p>"Right-o! We'll leave the Red Flier somewhere and
tackle the game on foot."</p>

<p>"We can't leave the Red Flier alone," said Matt. "I
was going to suggest, Dick, that we run the car off the
road, between here and the cliffs, and that you stay with
it. I've got to look out for the machine, you know. I
came pretty near losing it, near Fairview, in Arizona,
and that gave me a jolt I'll never forget. It's a five-thousand-dollar
car, and if anything happened to it it
would be difficult to explain the matter satisfactorily to
Mr. Tomlinson."</p>

<p>"I smoke you, mate," returned Ferral. "You've butted
into this affair of mine, and if you were to lose the old
flugee on account of it, I'd feel worse than you. I'll
stay with the thing, and you can be sure nothing will
happen to it. You and Carl go hunt for the spook-car.
I'll wait. How far do you intend to hoof it over
the cliffs?"</p>

<p>"If necessary, I'd like to go clear to that gully where
the machine flashed into the cliff road ahead of us; but
I'm particularly anxious to look over the ground this
side of the turn, at the place where the white car vanished
so mysteriously."</p>

<p>"Crack the nut! If any one can do it, by jingo, it's
Motor Matt."</p>

<p>By then they had reached a point about half-way between
La Vita Place and the cliffs. Here, off to one
side of the road, there was a patch of timber, and Matt
turned the Red Flier, ran across the flat ground, and
drew up among the trees.</p>

<p>"Here's a good shady place for you to wait, Dick,"
said Matt. "Carl and I may not be back before noon."</p>

<p>"Take your time, mate. I'm the greatest fellow to
sojer in the dog-watch you ever saw. Take your turn-to,
and when you want me on deck, just give the call."</p>

<p>Matt and Carl got out, returned to the road, and proceeded
on toward the cliffs.</p>

<p>The road was a straight stretch clear to the first turn
that carried it to the edge of the precipice. Matt and
Carl remarked upon this as they strode forward.</p>

<p>"A pad blace for any one to come in der nighdt, oof
dey vas regless," observed Carl. "I don'd vant to go
ofer dot roadt again in der nighdt, nod me."</p>

<p>"We won't have to go over it again with our lamps,
Carl," said Matt. "It won't take us long to run to
Lamy, get an officer, and come back to La Vita Place.
If we get back to the Red Flier by noon, we can make
the round trip to town by four o'clock, and have half an
hour to get our dinner."</p>

<p>"Sure! Dot's der talk. Aber I don'd t'ink ve vas
going to findt der vite car, Matt."</p>

<p>"I'm not expecting to find the white car, but I want
to discover how it managed to vanish like it did."</p>

<p>Carl shook his head gruesomely. He was still half-inclined
to credit the runabout with "shpook" proclivities,
and Matt's new plan didn't appeal to him very powerfully.</p>

<p>When they came to the chasm they paused to note
how the road, in reaching its treacherous path along the
edge, broke suddenly from a straight line into a sharp
curve. Certainly it was a bad place for motoring.</p>

<p>In order to get to the top of the cliff that edged the
road on the right, the boys had to do some hard climbing;
but when they were on the crest of the uplift, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
view that stretched out around them was ample reward
for their toil.</p>

<p>On their left they could look down on the ribbon of
road, winding between the foot of the cliff and the chasm;
and on their right they looked away toward a swale,
which made the cliff-tops a sort of divide.</p>

<p>"Dot gulch down dere," shuddered Carl, looking over
the cliff, "iss more as a million feed teep, I bed you."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Matt, "but it's deep
enough."</p>

<p>"Oof Verral hat dumpled from dot push," went on
Carl, "he vould haf gone clear py China."</p>

<p>"That swale," said Matt, pointing in the other direction,
"is where the gully enters the hills. As the gully
runs on toward Lamy it comes closer and closer to the
cliff trail."</p>

<p>He turned and looked behind him.</p>

<p>In the distance he could see the clump of timber where
Ferral had been left with the Red Flier; and beyond the
little patch of woods could be seen the larger grove that
sheltered La Vita Place. The touring-car was screened
from sight, and so was the adobe house. Matt was not
interested in either of them just then, however, but was
working out another problem in his mind.</p>

<p>"Carl," said he, "there's just a hint of a road leading
out of the swale and off toward La Vita Place."</p>

<p>"Vell, vat oof dot?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"Incidentally," answered Matt, "if one wanted to cut
off a good big piece of that dangerous road, in going to
Lamy, he could leave La Vita Place and follow the blind
track through the swale and gully, coming out on the
cliff trail just where the white runabout showed itself in
front of us last night."</p>

<p>"Py shiminy!" exclaimed Carl. "You're der feller to
vork mit your headt, Matt. Yah, so. Meppy dot's der
vay dot shpook car come oudt on us, hey? You t'ink she
come from La Fita Blace?"</p>

<p>"That's only a guess. The white car had to come from
somewhere. Let's go on."</p>

<p>They climbed across the rugged cliff-top, and as they
neared the turn where the white runabout had vanished
the night before, the gully angled quite close to them;
then, bending with the curve of the cliff road, went on
until it merged with the face of the cliffs.</p>

<p>At this point the cliff was not so high, with respect
to the road, and its face was not so steep. While Matt
was trying to figure out how the phantom auto had made
its abrupt disappearance, a sudden cry from Carl drew
his attention.</p>

<p>"Ach, du lieber!" faltered Carl. "Der teufel is coming
some more. See here, Matt!"</p>

<p>Matt, following Carl's shaking finger with his eyes,
saw the white runabout. Apparently of its own volition,
it was proceeding Lamyward along the gully. Sometimes
it darted out of sight behind a rise in the gully
wall, and again it came into full view, white, gleaming,
and presenting a most uncanny spectacle.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DARING LEAP.</p>


<p>While Matt watched the car an idea darted through his
head.</p>

<p>"The way to find out about that auto is to capture it,"
said he, speaking quickly.</p>

<p>"How you vas going to do dot?" queried Carl. "Oof
ve hat der Ret Flier along, meppy ve could oferhaul der
shpook, aber I don'd know vedder it vould be righdt to
indulch in any sooch monkey-doodle pitzness. Ven der
car puffs oudt mit itseluf, ve vould puff oudt mit it. Vere
you vas going, Matt?"</p>

<p>Matt was lowering himself over the top of the steep
bank, just around the curve above the cliff road.</p>

<p>"Come on," he called back, "and be careful. This is
dangerous work."</p>

<p>Carl was not in a mood to tamper with the white runabout,
nor was he in a mood to let Matt do the tampering
alone. Sorely against his will, he began lowering himself
down the steep bank, close beside his chum.</p>

<p>"Vy dis iss, anyvay?" he asked. "Vat a regless pitzness!
Oof ve lose holdt oof somet'ing, ve vould fall in
der roadt, undt meppy scood righdt ofer der roadt und
go down vere Verral ditn't go."</p>

<p>"Hang on, Carl, that's the thing to do," returned Matt.</p>

<p>"Yah, you bed you I hang on! I don'd vant to fall py
China und make some visits mit der Chings. I vouldn't
enchoy dot, as I vould be all in bieces. Aber for vy iss
dis, Matt? Vy you do dot?"</p>

<p>As they worked their way down the desperate slope,
hanging to stunted bushes and projecting rocks, Matt
explained.</p>

<p>"The white runabout may be going to Lamy," said he,
"but I hardly think it would show up in the town like
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Id vould schare der peobles oudt oof deir vits oof it
dit!" puffed Carl. "Wow!" he fluttered, making a slip
and only saving himself a fall by grabbing a bush with
both hands. "A leedle more, Matt, und you vouldn't haf
hat no Dutch bard."</p>

<p>"But it's my opinion," pursued Matt, completely
wrapped up in the work in hand, "that the runabout is
going to make the turn, just as it did last night, and
come back toward La Vita Place along the cliff road."</p>

<p>"Vy it do dot foolishness, hey?"</p>

<p>"Give it up. Perhaps we'll know all about it before
long. Find a good place, about six feet above the road,
and hang on."</p>

<p>"Yah, you bed my life I don'd ged indo der roadt oof
der shpook pubble iss coming. I vould haf to ged oudt
oof der vay, und meppy I vould go ofer der edge like
vat Verral dit, und you couldn't haf some ropes to helup
me oudt. I vas fixed all righdt, Matt."</p>

<p>Carl had planted himself on a good foothold and was
clinging to a stunted bush. Matt was on a level with
him and a little to one side.</p>

<p>"Listen!" cried Matt.</p>

<p>It was impossible, of course, for the boys to see around
the shoulder of the cliff, but a low murmuring sound
reached their ears, growing quickly in volume.</p>

<p>"Dot's it!" said Carl excitedly; "she vas coming, I
bed you! She vill go py righdt unter us, und ve can
look down und see vat ve can see, vich von't be nodding.
Aber I vish dot I vas some odder blace as here. Oof
dot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carl broke off his talk. Just then the white car came
spinning around the curve.</p>

<p>What Motor Matt was intending to do Carl hadn't the
least notion, but he was pretty sure it must be something
reckless.</p>

<p>The car was nearly upon them when Motor Matt, a
resolute gleam in his gray eyes, loosened his hold on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
rocks. Carl's shock of tow-colored hair began to stand
up like porcupine bristles. Something was about to happen,
and he caught his breath.</p>

<p>Then something <i>did</i> happen, and the Dutch boy got
back his breath with a rush.</p>

<p>"Look a leedle oudt!" yelled Carl, as Motor Matt made
a quick jump for the phantom auto.</p>

<p>It was a daring leap&mdash;so daring that Carl hung to his
bush with both hands and expected to see his chum either
miss the machine altogether or else carom off the opposite
side, bound into the road, and go hurtling into the
chasm.</p>

<p>But Matt was too athletic, his nerves were too steady,
and his eyes too keen for that.</p>

<p>Carl saw him land in the front of the white runabout in
a heap. He was thrown violently against the seat, and
then went sprawling against the dash. The runabout
slewed dangerously, and something like a squeal came
from somewhere.</p>

<p>"Ach, chincher," panted Carl; "he vas some goners!
I don'd nefer expect to see Motor Matt alife any more!
Donnervetter! Vy he do dot?"</p>

<p>Quickly as he could, Carl dropped into the road.</p>

<p>"Matt!" he called, whirling about and looking in the
direction the white car had been going.</p>

<p>Then he staggered back against the rocks.</p>

<p>The auto had disappeared and taken Motor Matt along
with it!</p>

<p>Carl's nerves were in rags. He didn't know what to
do. Possessed with the notion that Matt had faded into
nothing along with the spook car, he turned and began
running the other way.</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, however. Matt was his pard,
and to run away from him like that was something Carl
knew he ought not to do. But was he running away
from Matt? If Matt had been snuffed into nothing with
the car, how could he be running away from him?</p>

<p>This was all foolish, of course, but Carl was so upset
he wasn't himself.</p>

<p>He stopped his running, however, and came stealthily
back, staring on all sides of him with eyes like saucers.</p>

<p>"Now vat I vas going to do?" he groaned. "Dere
don'd vas a Modor Matt any more, und dere iss der
Red Flier, pack along der roadt, und Verral, und sooch
a mess as I can't dell at der La Fita Blace. Ach, himmelblitzen!"</p>

<p>Carl, overcome by the dark outlook, sank down on the
rocks and covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>Near him the face of the cliff was covered with a
growth of bushes and trailing vines.</p>

<p>Suddenly Carl heard a voice that lifted him to his
feet as though a spring had been released under him.</p>

<p>It was his name! Somebody had called his name, and
it sounded like Matt's voice.</p>

<p>"Vot it iss?" demanded Carl, a spasm of hope running
through him.</p>

<p>"Come here!"</p>

<p>Carl looked all around, but without seeing where he
was to go.</p>

<p>"Iss dot you, Matt?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Vere you vas, den? How you t'ink I come py you
oof I don'd know dot? Chiminy grickets, aber dis iss
keveer!"</p>

<p>"I'm inside the cliff," Matt answered. "Push through
the bushes."</p>

<p>Carl stepped in front of the trailing vines and brush.</p>

<p>"Iss it all righdt?" he quavered.</p>

<p>"Come on, come on," called Matt impatiently.</p>

<p>Carl pushed the bushes and vines aside, revealing a
wide clear space which had been completely masked by
the foliage. The ground, breaking in a level stretch from
the cliff road, led smoothly away into the very bosom of
the cliff.</p>

<p>Still dubious, Carl pushed slowly on into the darkness.
The vines fell back behind him and the parted bushes
snapped across the opening.</p>

<p>"I can't see nodding!" he wailed.</p>

<p>"Come straight ahead," said Matt reassuringly. "I'm
only a little ways off, and the car is here, too."</p>

<p>"Iss der shpook in der car?"</p>

<p>Matt laughed.</p>

<p>"We'll settle this spook business in short order," said
he.</p>

<p>Carl reached the car, and felt Matt's hand guiding him
around the side.</p>

<p>"How you shtop der pubble, Matt?" faltered Carl.</p>

<p>"I didn't stop it; somebody else did that."</p>

<p>At that moment a muffled voice called:</p>

<p>"Get in de car, sahib! We go on to de daylight."</p>

<p>Carl gave a jump and grabbed hold of Matt.</p>

<p>"Who iss dot?" he fluttered.</p>

<p>"We'll find out before we're many minutes older,"
said Matt. "Get in, Carl."</p>

<p>Assisted by Matt, Carl got into one of the seats, while
Matt climbed into the other.</p>

<p>"All ready," announced Matt, in a loud voice.</p>

<p>Instantly a glow from the acetylene lamps flooded the
gloom ahead. The boys could see a rocky tunnel, wide
and high, leading straight on through the heart of the
cliff.</p>

<p>"Ach!" chattered Carl. "Ve go py kingdom come
now, I bed you."</p>

<p>"Hardly that," laughed Matt. "We're bound for daylight
once more. Wait and watch."</p>

<p>Swiftly and surely the white car glided on. Presently
the boys saw trailing vines and bushes ahead of them,
similar to the screen at the other end of the tunnel.</p>

<p><i>Snap!</i> Off went the lights. Then, with startling suddenness,
they brushed through the screen and were once
more in the broad light of day.</p>

<p>The gully lay before them, and when they had reached
the center of it the car came to a halt.</p>

<p>"Vouldn't dot knock you shlab-sitet?" murmured Carl
wonderingly. "In vone door und oudt der odder! Ach,
blitzen, und den some! Aber who vas dot vat shpoke
in der tark?"</p>

<p>"Here's where we find out," rejoined Matt, leaping
down.</p>

<p>Carl likewise gained the ground. As he did so, the
deck of the car, behind the seats, lifted slowly until it
lay wide in an upright position.</p>

<p>Then a form slowly rose, a form with a chocolate-colored
face, the head crowned with a white turban.
Jumping from the boxlike recess in the rear of the car,
the form stretched itself and salaamed.</p>

<p>"You surprise', sahib? Ah, ha!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DESPERATE VILLAINY.</p>


<p>Although Matt and his friends did not know it, yet
the course taken by the Red Flier on leaving La Vita
Place was watched.</p>

<p>Joe Mings, climbing a tree, kept the car under his
eyes. In the distance he saw it leave the road, then he
could make out two figures returning on foot to the
road and proceeding toward the cliffs. He called down
the result of his observations.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose they're up to?" asked Sercomb,
with a worried look, as Mings slid back to the ground.</p>

<p>"I pass," replied Harry Packard, one of the most lawless
of the quartet; "but it's a fair gamble, Ralph, that
they're not up to any good."</p>

<p>"I should say not," said Balt Finn, the driver of the
touring-car. "That Ferral is after Mings' hide."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mings sullenly, "I wouldn't have gone
through Ferral in Lamy if you hadn't said so, Ralph."</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what their game is," mused Sercomb.
"Mings, you and Packard go to the place where they left
the car. If you can smash the car some way, they won't
be able to go to Lamy until we're ready to leave here."</p>

<p>"A nice jaunt before breakfast!" muttered Packard.</p>

<p>"We can stand it, I reckon," scowled Mings. "Let's
take a drink all around and try it, anyhow."</p>

<p>Packard pulled a flask from his pocket and took a
swallow of its fiery contents; then he passed the flask
to Mings.</p>

<p>"You fellows have got some in the house," said Packard,
corking the flask and returning it to his pocket. "Joe
and I will take this with us. Maybe we'll need it," and
he winked at Mings.</p>

<p>"Be careful what you do to the fellow that stayed with
the car," cautioned Sercomb.</p>

<p>"Suppose it's Ferral?"</p>

<p>"Then," returned Sercomb, with a significant look, "be
careful <i>how</i> you do what you're going to. You fellows
fell down last night."</p>

<p>"I'll not forget in a hurry the thumping that Ferral
and the Dutchman gave us," growled Packard.</p>

<p>"And don't you forget, Mings," said Sercomb, "what
Ferral will do to you if he gets to Lamy. Smash the
car."</p>

<p>Mings and Packard started off briskly toward the place
where the Red Flier had been left. The spot was not
more than half a mile from La Vita Place.</p>

<p>Ferral, all unconscious of the fact that two of his
enemies were approaching, sprawled out in the front
seat of the Red Flier and puzzled his brain over the
queer situation in which he found himself.</p>

<p>He could make nothing of it, and as time slipped away
his brain grew more and more befuddled. He was hoping
Matt and Carl might discover something of importance,
or, if they did not, that when the Red Flier returned
from Lamy with an officer, the law might do something
to clear up the mystery in which Uncle Jack had plunged
everything at La Vita Place.</p>

<p>A deep quiet reigned in the little grove. A droning
of flies was the only sound that disturbed the stillness.
The warm air and the silence made Ferral drowsy.</p>

<p>Once he roused up, thinking he heard a sound somewhere
around him; then, assuring himself that he was
mistaken, he sank back on the front seat and his nodding
head bowed forward.</p>

<p>Suddenly, before he could do a thing to protect himself,
a quick arm went round his throat from behind, and
he felt some one catch his feet from the side of the car.
He gave a shout of consternation as his head bent backward
and his eyes took in the face that leered above him.</p>

<p>It was the face of Mings!</p>

<p>"Caught!" laughed Mings hoarsely. "Thought you'd
shaken us, eh? Well, you were shy a few!"</p>

<p>"Just a few!" tittered the voice of the man on the
ground.</p>

<p>"Here's a rope," went on Mings, kicking the coiled
riata, which Matt carried in the car, out through the
swinging door. "Take it and tie his legs, Harry. I'll
hold him. Got a strangle-grip and he can't budge."</p>

<p>As soon as Packard let go his hold, Ferral began to
kick and struggle; but Mings was in such a position that
he could keep him very easily from getting away.</p>

<p>Packard, although tipsy from the effects of the liquor
he and Mings had imbibed on the way from La Vita
Place, tied one end of the rope quickly about Ferral's
ankles. The free end of the rope was then wound around
the seat and Ferral's hands were made fast behind him.
In a few minutes he was bound to the seat and absolutely
helpless. Mings and Packard, gloating over his predicament,
got around in front of the car.</p>

<p>"How do you like that?" asked Packard.</p>

<p>"He likes it," hiccoughed Mings; "you can tell that
by the looks of him."</p>

<p>"You're a fine lot of swabs!" exclaimed Ferral contemptuously.
"Sercomb ordered me off the place, and
I slanted away; now you follow me with your beach-comber
tricks. Oh, yes, you're a nice lot! What are
you trying to do?"</p>

<p>"Going to smash the car," answered Mings.</p>

<p>"You keep your hands off this car!" cried Ferral, realizing
suddenly that he had been caught napping, and
that Motor Matt might get into a lot of trouble on account
of it.</p>

<p>"Well," grinned Packard, "you just watch us."</p>

<p>"Are you going to Lamy?" demanded Mings.</p>

<p>"That's where I'm going!" declared Ferral resolutely.</p>

<p>"Not to-day you won't; and not in this car. We're
going to fix Motor Matt for butting into our plans, and
we're going to fix you so you won't get to Lamy and
back before we're on the road to Denver. You're cute,
but you're not so cute as we are. Oh, no! Is he, Packard?"</p>

<p>"We're the boys!" observed Packard.</p>

<p>They were both partly intoxicated. Naturally lawless,
the liquor they had taken had made them more so.</p>

<p>"See here," said Ferral, desperately anxious to save
the car, "you've got some of my money, Mings, and I
could have you jugged for taking it, but if I'll promise
not to get an officer and to let you keep the money, will
you leave this car alone? It doesn't belong to Motor
Matt, and he's responsible for it. I was left here to
watch it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nice watchman!" sputtered Packard; "fine watchman!
Eh, Mings?"</p>

<p>"Dandy watchman!" and Mings laughed loudly. "He
didn't hear a sound when I sneaked into the tonneau. I
tell you what, Packard!" he exclaimed, as a thought ran
suddenly through his befogged brain.</p>

<p>"Well, tell it!" urged Packard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's send him to Lamy."</p>

<p>"Send him to Lamy?"</p>

<p>"Sure! Let's put him in the road and open the car
up! Mebby he'll get to Lamy."</p>

<p>"He'll smash into the rocks, that's what he'll do."</p>

<p>"Well, that'll fix the car. By the time Motor Matt
pulls Ferral out of the wreck, I guess he won't feel like
getting an officer."</p>

<p>Ferral could hardly believe his ears.</p>

<p>"You scoundrels wouldn't dare do a thing like that!"
he cried.</p>

<p>"He says we wouldn't dare, Packard," mumbled Mings.</p>

<p>"He don't know us, eh, Mings?"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;not even acquainted. Let's throw the old benzine-buggy
against the rocks, and give Motor Matt
a surprise."</p>

<p>"He'll be surprised, all right. Serve him right, too,
for meddling with Sercomb's business."</p>

<p>"He's a meddler, that's sure. Dace Perry told me all
about him."</p>

<p>"Dace Perry's a blamed good fellow. He's one of our
set."</p>

<p>"Can you navigate the car to the road?" asked Packard.</p>

<p>"Navigate a dozen cars! Anything more in the flask?"</p>

<p>"All gone," answered Packard gloomily.</p>

<p>"Well, there's more back at the house."</p>

<p>Mings got into the car and Packard did the cranking.
When the car started it nearly ran over Packard.</p>

<p>"Trying to kill me?" shouted Packard, rolling out of
the way.</p>

<p>"You're too slow," laughed Mings.</p>

<p>Fumbling awkwardly with the levers and the steering-wheel,
Mings managed to get the car into the road and
headed for the cliffs.</p>

<p>"Cut off a piece of that rope, Packard," called Mings.
"I'll tie the wheel so as to be sure the car goes to Lamy."</p>

<p>"That's right," answered Packard, "you want to be
sure."</p>

<p>He took out his knife, slashed a piece from the free
end of the rope, and handed it up to Mings. The latter
began lashing the wheel.</p>

<p>"Sercomb ought to give us a chromo for this," said
Packard, watching Mings as he worked.</p>

<p>"You tell him we ought to have a chromo," returned
Mings, with a foolish grin. "Sercomb's a blamed good
chap; nicest chap I know."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ferral's face had gone white. He was
fighting desperately with the ropes, but they held him
firmly and he could not free his hands. A sickening sensation
ran through him.</p>

<p>Neither Mings nor Packard had a very lucid idea of
what they were attempting. They were fair examples of
what liquor can do for a person in certain situations.</p>

<p>"Belay!" cried Ferral desperately. "You don't understand
what you're doing, you fellows! You've headed me
for the cliffs, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're big and hard, those cliffs," said Mings, "and
you'll hit 'em with quite a jolt. But it'll only smash the
car, Ferral, and we had orders to smash the car."</p>

<p>Having finished with the wheel, Mings got on the running-board.
Packard cranked up again. Mings threw
in the clutch with his hand, pushed on the high gear,
and was thrown off as the car jumped ahead.</p>

<p>He collided with Packard, and both tumbled on the
ground and rolled over and over. When they had
struggled to their feet, the two scoundrels saw something
that almost sobered them.</p>

<p><i>It was the white runabout racing across the level
ground in the direction of the road and the flying red car!</i></p>

<p>But, what was even more strange, Motor Matt was in
the driver's seat of the runabout, and beside him was a
strange, turbaned figure which neither Packard nor Mings
had ever seen before.</p>

<p>On the ground, a long way in the rear of the racing
runabout, stood a figure which Packard and Mings recognized
as being that of Motor Matt's Dutch chum.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">TIPPOO.</p>


<p>The little brown man in the turban Matt instantly
recognized as a Hindu, undoubtedly the servant of Mr.
Lawton, Ferral's uncle.</p>

<p>Here was a find, and no mistake!</p>

<p>Tippoo had vanished at the same time Mr. Lawton
effected his queer disappearance, and the discovery of one
might easily lead to the finding of the other.</p>

<p>"Is your name Tippoo?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"<i>Jee</i>, sahib."</p>

<p>"Vat iss dat?" muttered Carl. "Gee! Iss it a svear
vort? He don'd look like he vas madt mit himseluf."</p>

<p>The Hindu certainly was taking his discovery in good
part. His brown face was parted in a perpetual smile,
and he seemed morbidly anxious to please.</p>

<p>"Does <i>jee</i> mean yes?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>The turban ducked vigorously.</p>

<p>"<i>Jee, Jee!</i>"</p>

<p>"Dot's two gees, vich means gootness cracious," bubbled
Carl, very happy to find that the ghost had been laid;
"und also it means jeerful. Led's try to be dot. So
der shly brown roosder vas in der pack oof der pubble
all der time! How he make it go, I vonder, ven he
don'd vas aple to see der vay?"</p>

<p>Matt was also curious on that point. Stepping closer
to the automobile, he looked into it, and saw a wonderful
combination of mirrors and levers.</p>

<p>The smiling Hindu, observing the trend of the boys'
interest, advanced and doubled himself up in the back of
the runabout.</p>

<p>As he lay there, in tolerable comfort and with a cushion
under his head, there was a mirror in front of his
eyes. Other mirrors, set at various angles, cunningly
reflected the scenery in front of the car. When the deck
was closed down it was evident that the enclosed space
became a sort of camera obscura.</p>

<p>Convenient to the Hindu's right hand was a small
wheel with an upright handle on its rim. As he turned
the wheel he steered the car&mdash;entirely independent of the
steering-wheel in front. The spark was manipulated by
a small lever near the wheel, and so were the throttle,
the brakes, and the gears. Strangest of all, though, was
the arrangement for cranking inside the box. This device
was so ingenious that it should have entitled its
originator to a patent.</p>

<p>"But vat's der goot oof it all?" queried Carl. "For
vy shouldt a feller vant to pen himseluf oop in a smodery
leedle blace like dot und leaf der two frondt seads vagant?
Ach, vat a foolishness!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt also wondered at that.</p>

<p>"Why do you ride in such cramped quarters, Tippoo,"
asked Matt, "when you could just as well ride on a seat?"</p>

<p>"Baud mens, sahib," said Tippoo, clutching his forehead
with one hand and bowing forward.</p>

<p>"Where were you going in the car?"</p>

<p>"'Round-around, 'round-around."</p>

<p>"Ring aroundt a rosy," said Carl. "I haf blayed dot
meinseluf, aber nod mit a pubble."</p>

<p>"Where is Lawton, sahib?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"<i>Jee, jee!</i>" exclaimed the Hindu.</p>

<p>"He talks vorse der longer vat he speaks," said Carl
disgustedly. "Ven ve vas in der tunnel, he shpeak pooty
goot, aber now he don'd say nodding like vat ve can undershtand."</p>

<p>Matt despaired of being able to find out anything he
wanted to know, and thought it would be well to take
Tippoo to Ferral.</p>

<p>"You know Dick Ferral?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"<i>Jee!</i>"</p>

<p>"Do you know where we left the red automobile?"</p>

<p>"<i>Jee!</i>"</p>

<p>"Gee stands for grazy, too, vich he iss," said Carl.</p>

<p>"Will you take us to our car?" went on Matt.</p>

<p>"Awri'," answered the Hindu.</p>

<p>"Dot's pedder," said Carl.</p>

<p>Tippoo lowered the deck carefully over the queer
mechanism in the box, and motioned Matt and Carl to
get into the car. Matt got into the driver's seat, having
a mind to run the car himself, and Carl got into the
other one. Tippoo stood in front of Carl, getting in after
he had "turned over" the engine by means of the crank
in front. He watched Matt sharply, evidently wanting
to make sure that he knew what he was about.</p>

<p>Matt started along the gully, marveling at the smooth
course its bottom offered.</p>

<p>The runabout responded quickly to the slightest turn
of the steering-wheel, and every other part of the mechanism
worked to perfection.</p>

<p>Tippoo, delighted at the skill with which Matt handled
the car, bent over and gave him an approving slap on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Chimineddy!" laughed Carl, "der prown feller likes
you, Matt."</p>

<p>"I guess he likes the way I run the car," said Matt.
"It's a little dandy! I never handled a machine that
purred along in neater style. I wish I knew more about
the get-up in the back part of it."</p>

<p>"Ven somebody blays der shpook schust for foolishness,
I don'd like dot," said Carl. "You mighdt haf got
your prains knocked oudt by chumping indo der car&mdash;und
all pecause der prown feller vanted to blay shpook!"</p>

<p>"Me play gose, sahib, but not to scare de good white
mans&mdash;only de baud white mans."</p>

<p>This from Tippoo, who was plainly keeping track of
the conversation.</p>

<p>"Did you see us on the cliff road last night?" queried
Matt.</p>

<p>"<i>Jee.</i>"</p>

<p>"And you got away by running the machine into the
cliff?"</p>

<p>"<i>Jee</i>, sahib."</p>

<p>"You didn't have any lights. How could you see
where you were going?"</p>

<p>"Me know de road, no need de light till me get in de
tunnel, sahib."</p>

<p>"You stopped the car in the tunnel last night, and came
back into the road?"</p>

<p>Tippoo nodded.</p>

<p>"Why was that?"</p>

<p>"Me see fin' out if Dick sahib be awri'."</p>

<p>"Ah! You were worried about Dick, eh, and you came
back to see if he was all right."</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you wait till we could speak with you?"</p>

<p>"Naboob sahib give order no."</p>

<p>"Who is the 'nabob sahib'?"</p>

<p>Tippoo affected not to hear the question.</p>

<p>"He don'd vant to talk about dot," put in Carl. "He
shies all aroundt dot Uncle Chack."</p>

<p>"You came past the house in the road last night?"
asked Matt.</p>

<p>This question evidently startled the Hindu.</p>

<p>"Sahib see de car las' night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Me no see sahib."</p>

<p>"What were you riding past the other car for?"</p>

<p>"Try scare baud white mans. Try see dem. Naboob
sahib say so. <i>Jee!</i>"</p>

<p>"Then you must have been the one who fired that
revolver and put a bullet through the tire?"</p>

<p>For answer to this, Tippoo pulled a revolver from a
sash about his waist.</p>

<p>"Make lift board with head, make <i>dekke</i>, den bang!"
He laughed. "Fine shoot, eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly it was a fine shot," answered Matt. "Were
you trying to keep away from Dick sahib?"</p>

<p>"Try keep 'way from Dick sahib, and from Ralph
sahib. All same. Leave 'em 'lone. Naboob sahib say
so."</p>

<p>This conversation, which cleared up some more dark
points, carried the runabout out of the swale and onto
the flat stretch which led off in the direction of La Vita
Place. The course to the ranch paralleled, at a distance
of about a quarter of a mile, the other road that led
from the cliffs.</p>

<p>Matt turned the nose of the runabout so as to lay a
direct course for the patch of trees where the Red Flier
had been left. Before they had covered more than half
the distance between the swale and the trees, a loud cry
escaped the Hindu. His eyes were fastened upon the
other road.</p>

<p>"<i>Dekke!</i>" he called, pointing.</p>

<p>Matt looked in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>"Ach, dunder!" cried Carl. "Dere iss der Ret Flier
in der roadt, und some fellers vas aroundt it&mdash;two oof
dem."</p>

<p>"Dick sahib him tied in car!" shouted Tippoo. "Dey
let car go! Car go to de cliff, Dick sahib tied! <i>Kabultah!
Hurkut-jee! Hur-r-r-kut-jee!</i>"</p>

<p>Tippoo lifted his hands and wrung them in an agony
of fear and apprehension.</p>

<p>By that time Matt was able to take in the situation.
He saw Ferral, bound in the front of the car, and the car
speeding toward the cliffs and the chasm. Vividly before
his eyes floated that turn of the treacherous road. The
car would go straight until it reached the turn, and then,
if no one was at hand to stop it, the Red Flier would go
into the chasm and carry Ferral with it.</p>

<p>Motor Matt's face set resolutely.</p>

<p>"I'm going to slow down, Carl," said he, "and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
pile out! There's too much freight for the race we've
got to make."</p>

<p>"All righdt! Don'd led nodding habben, bard, now ven
ve're so near droo mit dis monkey-dootle pitzness."</p>

<p>Carl jumped for the ground, and Tippoo sank limply
into his seat.</p>

<p>Matt immediately threw on the high speed, giving an
angle to the car's course which would lay it alongside
the Red Flier.</p>

<p>Like a flash, the white car leaped over the flat ground,
Tippoo still wringing his hands and muttering fearfully
to himself.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">IN THE NICK OF TIME.</p>


<p>There was no road-bed under the wheels of the white
runabout, but, for all that, the earth was firm, although
rilled, at irregular distances, with little sandy ridges.
The car, being light, seemed fairly to leap over these
small rises.</p>

<p>The Hindu had to hang to his seat with both hands
in order to keep from being hurled out of the car. His
turban was jolted down over his eyes, and after he had
tried to knock it back into place half a dozen times, he
flung it down on the floor of the car.</p>

<p>"We come close, closer!" he breathed, leaning forward
in his seat and peering steadily at the big touring-car.
"Naboob sahib be big mad at dis. We save Dick sahib!"</p>

<p>Matt could see that they were rapidly overhauling the
Red Flier, but, as he measured the gain, he knew they
would have only a scant margin, at best, if they kept
Ferral and the car from shooting into the chasm.</p>

<p>Flinging across the road a dozen feet behind the Flier,
Matt brought the runabout closer on that side.</p>

<p>"I'm going to jump from this car to the other one,
Tippoo," he shouted, "as soon as we get where I can do
it. The minute I jump, you be sure and grab the steering-wheel
and take care of the runabout. Understand?"</p>

<p>"<i>Jee</i>, sahib!"</p>

<p>Ferral was able to twist his head around and keep track
of the gallant race the runabout was making. He must
have been astounded to see the white car, with Matt
and the Hindu, trailing after him.</p>

<p>"You're coming, mate!" he yelled. "Let 'er out for
all she's worth! The brink of the precipice is right
ahead!"</p>

<p>Matt was aware of their nearness to the abyss. A
few rods farther and they would be at the turn of the
road. The touring-car, of course, being lashed to run
on a straight line, would plunge to destruction unless
halted.</p>

<p>With a final spurt, Matt drove the runabout abreast
of the Red Flier. The two cars were now running side
by side, and not a second could be lost if Matt was to
transfer himself to the Flier in time to be of any assistance
to Ferral.</p>

<p>As he took his hands from the wheel, Tippoo leaned
sideways and gripped the rim. For an instant Matt was
poised on the foot-board, steadying himself by holding to
the seat. A moment more and he had thrown himself
across the gap between the two cars.</p>

<p>It was his second daring leap for that day, but this
jump was more dangerous than the other one, for, if he
had slipped, he would have had two cars to reckon with,
instead of one. Both cars were racing furiously, and
the Red Flier, with no hand to hold it, was taking all inequalities
of the road and plunging and swaying as it
rushed onward.</p>

<p>But Motor Matt never put his mind to anything that
he did not accomplish. Ferral drew back in the seat to
give him every chance, and Matt sprawled with a jar
that made the car shiver from crank to tail light.</p>

<p>Whether he was hurt or not did not appear. In a
flash he was up, cutting off the power and bearing down
on the emergency-brake.</p>

<p>It was a stop such as Matt hated to make, for fear
of wrenching the machinery, but it was either that or
go over into the chasm. As it was, the Red Flier ran
across the curve and quivered to a halt, with the front
wheels on the very brink. Matt and Ferral, from their
seats, could look over the hood and down into the dizzy,
swirling depths below.</p>

<p>Ferral's face was white as death, and he relaxed backward,
limp and gasping. Matt backed the Flier away,
and turned around, then drew his knife from his pocket
and cut the ropes that bound Ferral.</p>

<p>"Who did this, Dick?" he asked huskily.</p>

<p>"Two of my cousin's friends," replied Ferral, drawing
his hands around in front of him and rubbing his
chafed wrists. "Toss us your fin! What you've done
this day, messmate, Dick Ferral will never forget."</p>

<p>A shiver ran through him as he gripped Matt's hand.</p>

<p>"The murderous scoundrels!" muttered Matt, his eyes
flashing.</p>

<p>"They didn't mean it to be as bad as it was, I'll have
to give 'em credit for that. They had about three tots
of grog aboard, and aimed only to run the flugee into
the rocks and stave it in. They didn't know about that
jumping-off place, or else they'd forgotten about it."</p>

<p>"It's bad enough, all right. No matter if the Flier had
only smashed into the rocks, you might have been killed,
tied as you are. They sneaked up on you, back there
in that patch of timber?"</p>

<p>"Aye, and it was all my fault. I was mooning, and
that gave them a chance. If they hadn't caught me
from behind, I could have bested the two of them, for
they had been topping the gaff strong. I was careless,
Matt, and you might have lost the machine on account
of it."</p>

<p>"Bother the machine, old fellow! It was you that
brought my heart in my throat. In a pinch like that, it's
the man that counts, not the machinery he happens to
have along with him."</p>

<p>"Right-o! If there hadn't been a whole man in that
white car, I might as well have been sewed in a hammock
and slipped from a grating, with a hundred-pound
shot at my pins."</p>

<p>Tippoo had halted the runabout and had watched with
wide eyes while Matt made his hair-raising jump and
stopped the big car. He now leaped down from the runabout
and hurried to Ferral. Catching one of his hands,
he bowed over and pressed it to his temples.</p>

<p>"Sink me, but the fix I was in fair hid the curious part
of the rescue," went on Ferral. "Where'd you get hold
of Tippoo, Matt? And how did you come to have the
white car handy?"</p>

<p>In a few words Matt straightened out the situation so
it was clear to Ferral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm a Fiji, Matt," breathed Ferral, "if you ain't chain-lightning
when it comes to doing things. Tippoo, where's
Uncle Jack?"</p>

<p>"Me no say, Dick sahib," answered Tippoo, dodging
the question.</p>

<p>"You can tell me whether he's dead or alive, can't
you?" roared Ferral.</p>

<p>"Me no say, Dick sahib," persisted Tippoo. "You
come 'long La Vita Place&mdash;come 'long with Tippoo."</p>

<p>"I was ordered away from there by Sercomb. If I go
any place, it will be to Lamy after an officer. I'll raise
a jolly big row with that gang at La Vita Place, scuttle
'em!"</p>

<p>Tippoo stared blankly at Ferral.</p>

<p>"Ralph sahib order Dick sahib away?" repeated the
Hindu, as though he scarcely believed his ears.</p>

<p>"He said he had found Uncle Jack's remains, and the
will, and that the will left everything to him, and he
ordered me and my mates away."</p>

<p>Tippoo bent forward and gripped his forehead.</p>

<p>"<i>Joot baht, joot baht!</i>" he mumbled.</p>

<p>"Blast his lingo!" growled Ferral. "It takes Uncle
Jack to get the lay of him."</p>

<p>"Dick sahib, you go with Tippoo back to La Vita
Place?"</p>

<p>The Hindu was so deeply in earnest that he compelled
Ferral's attention.</p>

<p>"What do you want me back there for?"</p>

<p>"You go, you learn all&mdash;ever'thing," and Tippoo flung
his arms out in a comprehensive gesture.</p>

<p>"Now, strike me lucky, the beggar knows something.
Yes, we'll go, if for nothing more than to walk in on
my dear cousin Ralph and face Mings and Packard.
Get into your old catamaran, Tippoo, and bear away.
We'll hold you hard during the run, if I'm any judge of
Motor Matt."</p>

<p>Tippoo went back to the runabout, got into the seat,
and started for La Vita Place.</p>

<p>"Old Chocolate certainly is an A. B. at running that
craft," mused Ferral, watching the ease with which Tippoo
handled the runabout. "But what was the good of
all that Flying Dutchman business? Why did Tippoo
want to tuck himself away in the locker behind when he
could ride up in front in comfort and like a gentleman?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," answered Matt, "that we'll find all that
out when we get back to La Vita Place."</p>

<p>A glint came into Ferral's eyes.</p>

<p>"Will we?" he cried, bringing his fist down on his
knee. "Aye, mate, even if I have to take Ralph Sercomb
by the throat and shake the whole blessed truth
out of him. If it's a game of dirks they're playing, I
warrant you they'll find me handy with mine."</p>

<p>"Go slow, Dick, whatever you do," counseled Matt.
"You've held yourself pretty well in hand, so far, and
you'll be the gainer for it."</p>

<p>They had been wheeling along the road at a good clip,
and came finally to a place where Carl was waiting for
them.</p>

<p>"Vell, vell!" cried Carl, as Matt stopped for him to
hop into the tonneau, "vot kindt oof a rite vas dot you
dook mit yourseluf, Verral?"</p>

<p>"The kind, mate," answered Ferral, "that I hope I'll
never take again."</p>

<p>"Yah, I bed you! Modor Matt chumped in und
shtopped der car, hey? I knew dot he vould. Ven he
geds dot look in his eyes, py chincher, like vat he hat,
you can bed someding for nodding his madt vas oop.
How did it habben, Verral?"</p>

<p>And while Ferral was rehearsing the whole story for
Carl's benefit, the white runabout and the Red Flier came
to a halt in the road in front of La Vita Place.</p>

<p>Tippoo jumped down and motioned for those in the
rear car to follow him.</p>

<p>"Tippoo is the boss, Dick," said Matt; "get down and
we'll trail after him. Don't let your temper get away
from you when we're in the house."</p>

<p>"The way I feel now, matey," answered Ferral, "I'd
like to sail in and lay the 'cat' on the whole bunch. A
precious crew they are, and no mistake."</p>

<p>Tippoo led the way along the foot-path, and Ferral,
Matt, and Carl followed him closely.</p>

<p>Voices could be heard in the house, and it was clear
Sercomb and his companions had not noticed the approach
of the two cars.</p>

<p>Standing by the door, the Hindu motioned for the boys
to pass in ahead of him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A STARTLING INTERRUPTION.</p>


<p>The parlor at La Vita Place, as has already been
stated, covered half of the first floor of the house. The
distinctive feature of the large room was an immense
fireplace, which, after the Mexican fashion, was built
across one corner. Above the fireplace, on the angling
surface that reached from wall to wall, was a dingy, life-size
painting of a saint. The painting was in a heavy
frame, which was set flush with the wall.</p>

<p>There were a few things about the old adobe <i>casa</i>
which had been left exactly as they had come into Mr.
Lawton's hands from the original Mexican owners of the
place. This picture of the saint was one of them.</p>

<p>The parlor was finely furnished. The floors were laid
with tiger and lion-skins, trophies of the chase, and on
every hand were curios and ornaments dear to the eccentric
old Englishman because of their associations.</p>

<p>In this room Sercomb and his Denver friends were
gathered. They had had their breakfast&mdash;Mings and
Packard had just finished theirs&mdash;and all were excitedly
discussing what Mings and Packard had done, and what
they had seen.</p>

<p>Mings and Packard, it may be stated, had been sufficiently
sobered by their experiences, and not a little
frightened.</p>

<p>"Confound the luck, anyhow!" cried Sercomb. "Nothing
seems to go right with me. If you fellows had got
hold of Ferral last night, all this couldn't have happened
to-day."</p>

<p>"If we'd done that, Ralph," said Mings gloomily, "we
don't know what would have happened to-day. Motor
Matt and that Dutch pal of his would have been left, and
they'd have kicked up a big ruction when they found
Ferral had disappeared."</p>

<p>"We could have taken care of Motor Matt and the
Dutchman," snapped Sercomb, "and Mings and Packard
could have run Ferral away in the automobile and
dropped him so close to the quicksands that he'd have
wandered into them in the dark. He'd never have shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
up here to make me any trouble." Bitterness throbbed in
Sercomb's voice. "That fellow has been a drawback to
me ever since we were kids, and now he's got to step in
and try to knock me out of Uncle Jack's money!"</p>

<p>"You wasn't a favorite of your Uncle Jack, eh?"
queried Balt Finn.</p>

<p>"No, blast the old codger! He never seemed to like
me, and I was always around him. Dick, who never
came near, was the one he had always in mind."</p>

<p>"Well, has the old fluke cashed in?" asked Packard.
"That's the point."</p>

<p>"Of course he has! He was always a high liver, and
it's a wonder apoplexy didn't take him long ago. Feeling
that he was about to die, he made his will, put it in
his pocket, and tucked himself away somewhere, just to
see whether Dick or I would be first to locate him.
Precious little I care about the old juniper, if I could
lay hands on the will."</p>

<p>"The one you've made out, Ralph," said Packard, "is
pretty well gotten up. You've imitated your uncle's signature
in great shape."</p>

<p>"The deuce of it is," returned Sercomb, "I don't know
just what property he's got, so I can schedule it. If I
could find the original will, I could copy that part of it."</p>

<p>"Maybe," suggested Finn, "this is only a tempest in a
teapot, and that the old man left you all his property,
after all."</p>

<p>"I don't know, of course, but I'm afraid he's given
Dick too much. I don't want him to have a cent."</p>

<p>"Well," growled Mings, "I'm hoping you'll make good
your claim to the estate, Ralph. You've promised to remember
us all around, you know."</p>

<p>"That promise goes!" averred Sercomb. "Once I get
my hooks on Uncle Jack's money, you can bet I'll do the
handsome thing by you fellows. Just now, though, what
we've got to think about is this: Dick was started toward
the cliffs in that car of King's, and King showed
up in that confounded white runabout and chased after
Dick and the touring-car. What I'd like to know, did
King save Dick? Everything hangs on that. If Dick
got smashed against the cliffs, he can't tell about that
Lamy business, nor about Mings and Packard tying him
in the car. You fellows," and here Sercomb turned to
Mings and Packard, "ought to have hung around to see
how it came out."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," returned Mings sarcastically, "we ought to
have hung around and given them a chance to nab us.
I guess not! We got back here as quick as we could.
But you take it from me&mdash;King never saved Ferral."</p>

<p>"You fellows went too far," continued Sercomb. "I
told you to smash the car, but I didn't tell you to smash
Ferral along with it."</p>

<p>"That's what you meant, Sercomb, whether you said
it or not," spoke up Packard. "You wanted him taken
away last night and dropped in the quicksands&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wanted him put out of the car close to the quicksands,"
qualified Sercomb, "so that he'd have got into
them himself."</p>

<p>"It's all the same thing," said Balt Finn. "Call a spade
a spade and don't dodge."</p>

<p>"Who was that fellow with the queer head-gear we saw
in the car?" asked Packard.</p>

<p>A look of dismay crossed Sercomb's face.</p>

<p>"If that was Tippoo&mdash;&mdash;" he began, but got no farther.</p>

<p>Just then there were steps in the hall, and Ferral entered
the room, followed by Matt and Carl. Sercomb
and his guilty associates jumped to their feet.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, Dick!" exclaimed Sercomb, staring.</p>

<p>"Yes, you cannibal!" shouted Ferral; "it's Dick, but no
thanks to you and your gang of pirates that I'm here,
alive and kicking. Now, Mings, confound you, you and
Packard have got a chance to tell me whether my dear
cousin put you up to that job over toward the cliffs."</p>

<p>"We've got a chance to run you off the place, that's
what we've got," answered Mings.</p>

<p>"Heave ahead!" cried Ferral, squaring himself. "I'd
like a chance at you, just one."</p>

<p>Mings glared at him, but remained sullenly silent. Ferral
turned to Sercomb.</p>

<p>"I'm here to sink a lead to the bottom of this, my gay
buck," said he, "and before I turn my back on La Vita
Place I'll know the truth. What have you done with
Uncle Jack? A scoundrel who'd treat me as you have
wouldn't hesitate to deal foully with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there, Dick," interrupted Sercomb, fluttering
his hand, "that will do you. You're judging me by yourself."</p>

<p>"I'm judging you by your actions," stormed Ferral.
"It's been tack-and-tack with you ever since I knew you,
and you never yet shifted your helm without having
something to gain for Sercomb. You cozzened around
Uncle Jack, toadying to him for his money; when he
disappears, you bear away for here, rip things fore and
aft looking for a will, and, when you fail to find one,
fix a document up to suit yourself. You're as crooked as
a physte's hind leg, and you couldn't sail a straight course
to save your immortal soul. Now, here's where I stand,
Ralph Sercomb: Either you'll tell me the whole of it
about Uncle Jack, or I go to Lamy and come back here
with an officer. If I do that, I'll round-up every man
Jack of you, and give you the hottest time you ever had
in your lives; but tell me the truth about Uncle Jack,
and I'll leave here and stay away."</p>

<p>"Uncle Jack is dead," declared Sercomb. "How many
times do you want me to tell you that?"</p>

<p>"That's still your play, is it?" scoffed Ferral. "Then,
between you and me and the capstan, my buck, you lie by
the watch!"</p>

<p>A hoarse cry escaped Sercomb. His hand swept under
his coat, and when it appeared a bit of steel glimmered
in his fist.</p>

<p>"Put up your gun," ordered Ferral. "You took one
shot at me with it last night, and if you try it again I'll
turn a trick you'll remember."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get out of here!" ordered Sercomb. "You can't come
into my place and talk to me like that."</p>

<p>He lifted the weapon, the muzzle full upon Ferral.
Matt and Carl stepped up shoulder to shoulder with Ferral,
and Mings, Packard, and Finn drew nearer to Sercomb.</p>

<p>A tense moment intervened, followed by a quick, pattering
footfall. Tippoo glided in and placed himself
resolutely between Ferral and the leveled weapon.</p>

<p>"Tippoo!" gasped Sercomb, stepping back and letting
the revolver drop at his side.</p>

<p>"<i>Jee!</i>" answered the Hindu.</p>

<p>His eyes were not fixed on Sercomb, nor on any one
else in the room, but on the dingy saint in the frame
over the mantel. He waved his arms sternly, separated
Sercomb and his friends, and passed through their gaping
ranks toward the fireplace.</p>

<p>The he salaamed, calling loudly: "Naboob sahib! Is
de time not come? <i>Dekke!</i>"</p>

<p>Thereupon a most astounding thing happened. While
those in the room stared like persons entranced, the great
frame that enclosed the pictured saint quivered against
the wall. Slowly it moved outward at the top, dropped
lower and lower, until it had passed the mantel and its
upper edge was resting on the floor. The inner side of
the picture, now disclosed, was arranged in a series of
steps, so that a stairway was formed from the mantel
downward. At the top of the short flight, gaping blackly
over the fireplace, a square recess was disclosed in the
angle formed by the two walls of the room.</p>

<p>For an instant the blank gloom was undisturbed; then,
slowly, a tall, gray-haired form showed itself. The form
was erect and soldierly, clad in black; the face was fine,
the forehead high, and the eyes quick and keen.</p>

<p>For a space this figure stood in the opening, the eyes
sweeping the room and finally resting on Ferral. While
still gazing at Ferral, the figure stepped over the mantel
with military decision and descended step by step until it
reached the floor.</p>

<p>The stairway lifted itself, when relieved of the weight,
swung upward, and closed the opening. Once more the
pictured saint was in the accustomed place.</p>

<p>"Dick!" called a voice.</p>

<p>The figure in black stepped forward with outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jack!" exclaimed Ferral, starting forward.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE PRICE OF TREACHERY.</p>


<p>This most astounding event had left everybody gasping.
A ghastly pallor had rushed into Sercomb's face. His
three companions were hardly in better case. All four
realized that the unexpected had happened, and that it
boded ill for them.</p>

<p>But Sercomb was not long in pulling himself together.</p>

<p>"Why, uncle!" he exclaimed, forcing a laugh; "this is
a tremendous surprise, and a glad one. I have been worried
to death about you!"</p>

<p>He offered his hand. Mr. Lawton looked at him steadily.
Under that look Sercomb's assurance faded, his hand
dropped, and he fell back.</p>

<p>"I would like you better, sir," said the old Englishman,
"if you showed the courage to acknowledge what you
have done and face the consequences. You must know
that I am aware of all that has taken place here; and yet
you have the brazen insolence to step forward and offer
me your hand!"</p>

<p>"I guess we'd better be going, Sercomb, old chap," said
Mings.</p>

<p>"I think so, too," spoke up Balt Finn. "It's getting
along toward noon, and we'll get out the car and start
north."</p>

<p>"Come on, boys," urged Packard.</p>

<p>They started toward the door. At a gesture from Mr.
Lawton, Tippoo stepped in front of the door and drew
the revolver from his sash. The Denver man fell back
in trepidation.</p>

<p>"You'll start north very soon," said Mr. Lawton
keenly, "and when you go you'll take Sercomb with you.
First, however, there is something to be told, and you'll
wait to hear it.</p>

<p>"Ever since I came to America I have had Ralph and
Dick in mind. Either I was to divide my property between
them, or else I was to cut off one and leave all to
the other. In some respects I am a particular man.
What property I have collected I want to fall into hands
that will do the most good with it. With that end in
view I have tried to make a study of Ralph and Dick.</p>

<p>"It was easy for me to study Ralph. Whenever I
asked him to come here and see me, he came; and he
remained, as a rule, until I asked him to go. He had
ways about him which I did not like, but I feared that
was merely a prejudice. I like the youth who is open
and aboveboard, who says what he means and who is
frank and fearless. Ralph did not seem to be that.</p>

<p>"Dick I never could get to come to me." Mr. Lawton
lifted his hand and rested it on Ferral's shoulder. "I
couldn't understand this, for by making a little of me he
had everything to gain. He was serving his king afloat&mdash;I
liked that&mdash;but I felt that he might take a little time
off for a visit, every two or three years, with the forlorn
old man 'way off here in the American wilds.</p>

<p>"When Dick wrote me from Texas, I conceived a
plan. By this plan I hoped to bring both my nephews
here, and to find out, beyond all cavil, just which was
the better entitled to what I shall some day leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"With the Lamy lawyer to help, the little conspiracy
was hatched. Identically the same letters were sent to
Ralph and Dick, each stating that I was tired of living
alone, that I was going to get out of the way, and that
wherever I was found my <i>will</i> would be found with me."</p>

<p>A grim smile hovered about the bristling gray mustache
of the old man.</p>

<p>"I did not say what the will was," he went on, "but I
will remark here that it was purely the mental process by
which I intended to judge which of my nephews was the
more worthy.</p>

<p>"Ralph lost no time in coming to La Vita Place. He
brought with him these friends of his"&mdash;Mr. Lawton
swept his hand about to indicate Finn, Mings and Packard&mdash;"and
they carried on with liquor and cards, spending
their time sleeping, eating, gambling and hunting for
the will. There was never any concern about Uncle Jack&mdash;their
interest was all in the will and Uncle Jack's
money. Everything that went on in this house I knew
about&mdash;as well as everything that went on outside. Tippoo,
with the aid of the runabout, kept me informed of
events beyond the walls; and, as for the others, I heard
and saw for myself.</p>

<p>"This old adobe house is like a medieval castle. In
the old times, when settlers were even fewer in this
country than they are now, lawless Mexicans used the
place for nefarious purposes; and, back beyond their
time, the old friars who were here under the Spaniards
made this their retreat. The walls are honeycombed
with passages, and every room can be reached secretly
and secretly watched. I discovered these passages for
myself, and have passed many a lonely hour unearthing
the mysteries of the place.</p>

<p>"Ralph, during one of his visits here, found the passage
leading from the bushes to my sleeping-room, up-stairs.
He knew of that, but none of the others.</p>

<p>"One thing I did not know about until now was
Ralph's plan to have Mings meet Dick in Lamy, when
he was coming here, and steal his money. It is hard
to think one of my blood is a thief&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uncle!" gasped Sercomb.</p>

<p>"Stand as you are, sir!" cried Mr. Lawton sternly.
"Let us name the truth as it should be! It was not your
hand that struck Dick down, and his money is not now
in your pocket, but yours was the plan, and you are even
more guilty than Mings. Although I could not protect
Dick from that danger, yet he was equal to it himself.</p>

<p>"When he came here, I was watching Ralph and his
friends playing cards up-stairs; I saw them put out the
light and retreat noiselessly to my bedroom; and I heard
the shot that was fired at Dick before the young rascals
left the house by the secret way.</p>

<p>"All the rest that followed, during the night, I understood,
save that I did not know, until I heard Matt talking
with Carl and Dick in my room, how he had been
able to spy upon Sercomb and his friends and gather a
clue to Sercomb's duplicity.</p>

<p>"The ruffianly attack on Dick and Carl by Mings and
Packard, who, under orders from Sercomb, were plotting
to carry Dick off to the quicksands, horrified me.
I would have shown myself then and there had not Dick
and Carl protected themselves so valiantly and turned the
tables on Dick's would-be abductors.</p>

<p>"Tippoo, in the car, was watching the automobile in
front, and he disabled the machine so that Dick could
not be carried off, in case Mings and Packard succeeded.</p>

<p>"The most contemptible act of all was that where
Mings and Packard followed Dick and his friends, when
they had been ordered away, and attempted Dick's
life&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did not sanction that!" cried Sercomb desperately.
His hopes were crumbling in his grasp like a rope of
sand. "I did not tell Mings to tie Dick in the car and
set the car toward the cliffs! Uncle! I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" thundered Mr. Lawton. "I will have no
false excuses. I know what you wanted! You wanted
to get Dick out of the way. In your greed to get all of
my property you shut your eyes to the heinousness of
your conduct and struggled only to achieve your aim.</p>

<p>"Here, in this house, Ralph, I have watched barefaced
duplicity and murderous resolve battling with frankness
and fearlessness! I have seen you deliberately, and with
three unscrupulous friends to help, play every card you
could in an attempt to beat your own cousin. And I
have felt shame that one of our line could act so like
a cur.</p>

<p>"Had I known, in the beginning, just how far your
greed would lead you, had I even remotely imagined
all the dangers that would encompass Dick when he tried
to follow out my last request, I would never have proceeded
in the way I did.</p>

<p>"But now it is over. I have seen you both when you
could not know I was near; I have watched your actions,
weighed even your words, and I am able to judge between
you."</p>

<p>A certain grimness of resolve came into the fine old
face as Mr. Lawton went on.</p>

<p>"Ralph, you can expect from me&mdash;nothing. When I
leave this place for good and all, and go to Denver&mdash;which
will be in a few days&mdash;there will not be even a
deed to La Vita Place to go to you. Considering my
present mood, not a shilling of my money, sir, will go
to you. To whom it <i>does</i> go, I will leave you to guess.
Go back to your racing; and if, before I die, you have
come nearer making a man of yourself, perhaps I will
reconsider. You and your friends have an automobile
in the barn. Take it, at once, and leave here."</p>

<p>A deep silence fell over the room. Tippoo stepped
away from the door and tucked the revolver back into his
sash. Mings, Packard and Finn bolted&mdash;glad, no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
to get away so easily. Sercomb started after them, but
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Uncle," he began tremulously, "if you will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go!" ordered Mr. Lawton sternly.</p>

<p>Then Sercomb's true character came uppermost. Halting
in the door he shook his fist at Matt and Dick.</p>

<p>"I'll play even with both of you for this!" he gritted,
then whirled and darted after his crestfallen companions.</p>

<p>"Come, Carl," said Matt, hurrying toward the hall
door, "we'll go and keep an eye on the car."</p>

<p>"You bed you," exulted Carl, running after Matt. "It
vas easy for Verral to be jeerful now, hey? Aber id
don'd vas so easy for dose odder chaps. Donnervetter,
vat a surbrise!"</p>

<p>When the other touring-car whisked out of the barn,
through the grove and into the road, there were four
very gloomy passengers aboard. Hardly looking at Matt
and Carl, they kicked up the dust toward Santa Fé and
Denver.</p>

<p>Tippoo appeared, as soon as the car had vanished.</p>

<p>"Sahib," said he to Matt, "you go to de house. I take
care of bot' cars. Naboob sahib say so."</p>

<p>"Napoo sahip cuts a goot deal oof ice mit us, Tibboo,"
said Carl, "und I guess dot ve go, hey, Matt?"</p>

<p>"Sure, we will," replied Matt. "But be careful of this
car, Tippoo. It has had so many close calls lately that
I am scared of my life when it's out of my hands."</p>

<p>"Me take good care, sahib," answered Tippoo reassuringly.</p>

<p>Matt and Carl, full of wonder and satisfaction because
of the way the affair had ended, started back along the
foot-path to the house.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE LUCK OF DICK FERRAL.</p>


<p>Mr. Lawton and Ferral met Matt and Carl in the parlor.
They had been having a brief talk together, and
there was a pleased look on Lawton's face and a happy
light in Ferral's eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawton stepped forward and caught Matt cordially
by the hand.</p>

<p>"Matt," said he, "you have been a stanch friend of
Dick's in the little time you have known him, and you
have twice saved his life. He is indebted to you, but I
am under an even greater obligation. But for your aid,
the little plan I conceived for getting at the relative merits
of my two nephews might have ended disastrously and
given me something to regret till the last day of my life.
I thank you, my lad; and you, too, Carl," he finished,
turning to the grinning Dutch boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, vell," said Carl, "it don'd vas nodding vat I dit.
Matt vas der vone. He iss alvays der vone dot geds dere
mit bot' feets ven anyding iss bulled off."</p>

<p>"You both did nobly, and perhaps some time, somewhere,
I can show you that I am not insensible of the
debt I owe," went on Mr. Lawton. "Just now," he added,
turning away and walking to the end of the mantel,
"Dick has expressed a desire to see the place where I
have lived for several days, and I presume you and Carl,
Matt, are also interested."</p>

<p>He pressed a spring under the end of the mantel and
the great frame descended and presented its flight of
steps.</p>

<p>"I will go first, as I know the ropes," said Mr. Lawton.
"The rest of you will follow."</p>

<p>He ascended the stairs. Dick, Carl and Matt went
after him and the frame closed and left them in a narrow
space in the dark. Mr. Lawton lighted a candle and
flashed it across the inner side of the picture and above
the last step.</p>

<p>"The eyes of the picture, you will see," he observed,
"are cut out. That gave me an opportunity to note what
took place in the parlor. A very old device which I have
seen in old castles on the Rhine, and even in one or two
houses in Delhi. Now," and he faced about, "we will
go on."</p>

<p>The passage wound around the house through the
hollow wall. Two steps led up and over the front door.
In the sitting-room there was a niche with a crucifix and
candles. Holes in the back of the niche enabled one to
look out and observe all that took place in the sitting-room.
In like manner, there was a concealed place for
keeping track of what went on in the kitchen.</p>

<p>In the kitchen wall a dozen steps led upward to the
second floor, and in the two upper rooms there were
also peep-holes cleverly arranged.</p>

<p>"The passage Ralph knew about," explained Mr. Lawton,
"has no connection whatever with this other burrow.
It is entirely distinct and apart. The only way to
get directly into the house from these corridors is by
the opening over the parlor mantel. Now we will descend
to the subterranean part of the establishment."</p>

<p>A continuation of the steps that led upward in the
kitchen wall conducted the explorers downward into a
place that was a sort of basement, although having no
connection with the cellar of the house.</p>

<p>Here the boys were surprised to find the white runabout.</p>

<p>"Here's a point I'm twisted on, Uncle Jack," said Dick.
"What in the name of the seven holy spritsails, did you
ever let Tippoo go spooking around the country for?"</p>

<p>Mr. Lawton laughed.</p>

<p>"Dick," said he, "this country is full of scoundrels who
would not hesitate to get the better of an old man and
his Hindu servant if there were a few dollars to be
gained. Now, rascals of that ilk are superstitious, and
I have kept them at bay by this harmless deception. This
old, ill-favored shell of a house is supposed to be haunted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
for dark deeds are known to have taken place here. That
auto is my own idea. Tippoo has made regular trips with
it every night up the gully, around on the cliff road,
through the cliff and so back to the house. La Vita
Place, by that means, has lived up to its unenviable reputation,
and the thieves have left me severely alone.</p>

<p>"The auto came in very handily during this play of
Ralph's. Ralph knew nothing about the car, and during
his visits here I was careful to keep a knowledge of it
away from him. Tippoo would take a trip abroad and
watch events outside; then he would come back and report
to me. When Matt jumped into the car, there on the
cliff road, Tippoo was willing enough to be discovered,
for he knew that I was planning to show myself very
soon, anyhow. Tippoo, however, had orders from me
to say nothing about what I was doing. Here," added
Mr. Lawton, stepping off along the rock-walled room,
"is the way the car left its quarters whenever it wanted
to make its ghostly round."</p>

<p>Matt, as he followed Mr. Lawton, noticed a supply of
gasoline and oil, and congratulated himself on the fact
that there would be no difficulty in getting the Red Flier
fit for the road when the time came for Carl and himself
to start.</p>

<p>A wide passage led for a hundred feet or more beyond
the end of the stone room, a gentle grade, at its farther
end, leading upward. A door, flush with the earth, was
pushed upward by Mr. Lawton, and the blinding light
of day flooded the passage.</p>

<p>"We might as well get out here," said Mr. Lawton,
and the rest followed him into a brushy covert in the
grove.</p>

<p>On one side of the covert the brush had been cleared
away to leave a smooth track for the car.</p>

<p>"The road," explained the old man, "leads directly to
the gully. Tippoo, when he desired to make his round,
had only to push up the door, take his ghostly ride, and
then come back again."</p>

<p>"That idea of a crank in the machine for turning over
the engine," said Matt, "is a mighty good one and ought
to be patented."</p>

<p>"You may have it, Matt," said Mr. Lawton. "I am
too old to bother with patents."</p>

<p>The door was closed and the little party wandered back
through the grove to the house. Tippoo, in the kitchen,
was busily at work getting a meal ready.</p>

<p>"This," observed Mr. Lawton, as they all seated themselves
on a bench in the shade, "is one of the happiest, as
well as the saddest, days of my life. I have discovered
what Dick really is, and that's where the bright part
comes in; but I have also found out that my sister's son
is a contemptible scoundrel&mdash;and I would rather have lost
everything I own than to have discovered it. This racing-game
must be demoralizing."</p>

<p>"It isn't the game, Mr. Lawton," interposed Matt
earnestly, "but the character of the fellows who take it
up. There isn't a thing in a speed contest to demoralize
any one."</p>

<p>"You may be right, Matt," answered Mr. Lawton, "but
it's hard to understand how Ralph could prove so false
to all the Lawton ideals. His father was a gentleman in
every sense of the word; and his mother&mdash;there was
never a finer woman on earth."</p>

<p>After a short silence, Mr. Lawton turned once more to
Matt.</p>

<p>"You are going to Santa Fé?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Matt, "and then to Denver. Mr. Tomlinson,
who owns the Red Flier, has a place for me on
the racing-staff of a firm of automobile-makers."</p>

<p>"Ah! I would have spoken differently a moment ago,
if I had known that you intended entering the racing-field.
You'll never go wrong. But, when you get to
Denver, beware of the rascally crew who just left here.
They are very bitter against you."</p>

<p>"They'll not bother me, sir," said Matt stoutly.</p>

<p>"Oof dey dry it on," spoke up Carl, "py chincher dey
vill ged somet'ing vat dey don'd like."</p>

<p>"Dick and I will be in Denver soon," said Mr. Lawton,
"and then we shall look you up. You will hear from us
again, Matt. The debt we are under to you cannot be
easily canceled."</p>

<p>"I've been repaid already," returned Matt. "What
I have done has given me a friend in Dick Ferral&mdash;and
that's worth everything."</p>

<p>"Your fin, mate," said Ferral, reaching over and clasping
Matt's hand.</p>

<p>Just then Tippoo appeared in the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"Tiffin, sahib!" he called, and they all filed into the
house&mdash;Carl, as usual when there was eating in prospect,
leading the way.</p>

<h2><a name="BILL" id="BILL">BILL, THE BOUND BOY.</a></h2>


<p>Bill Bradley was a blacksmith boy. He was an orphan,
and had been apprenticed to old Carnahan the day Lincoln
was elected, and had pumped the bellows and swung the
sledge every day since. Old Carnahan was a stern task-master,
and got out of his bound boy all the law would allow.
We used to pass the shop every time we drove from our
farm in the country, and there was nothing in the county
seat, the greatest town we had ever seen, so notable as the
great shock of fiery red hair displayed by Bill Bradley. He
always stood at the door of the shop as we passed at noon-time
and nodded at us with the cheeriest sort of a smile. It
was a thing to remember with pride when a town boy honored
us with recognition.</p>

<p>Money was mighty scarce in our house those days. Dimes
were things to treasure carefully; and dollars, when they
came, were something spoken of with bated breath and
hidden away&mdash;or paid out grudgingly. And iron was in
demand. The cannons made those first years of the war
called into requisition it seemed to me all the fragments of
old cast iron there was in the country. Blacksmiths were
paying first a cent, then two cents, and finally two and a
half cents a pound; though they did not make a difference
whether you "took it out in trade" or demanded cash.</p>

<p>We boys in the country used to gather up every bit of
metal that would sell, and carefully save it till we had a
hundred pounds or more, and then take it to town and convert
it into the infrequent cash or the almost as acceptable
and quite costly groceries.</p>

<p>One day when we took our plunder to town we found the
streets in strange commotion.</p>

<p>"They're listing soldiers," said a nervous voice in our
ears, and when we turned we found Bill Bradley, wide-eyed,
excited, and reckless. We were surprised, for we knew it
was time for him to be at the forge, and we knew how strict
was his employer in the matter of time.</p>

<p>We drove to the blacksmith shop with the fragments of
iron, and found Bill Bradley there before us. He was
pumping the bellows, and old man Carnahan was rating
him soundly for his absence. The red head was a trifle
higher, the blue eyes a trifle wider, and the breath was
quicker and more charged with warning. Carnahan should
have known. But he didn't. He grew more enraged, till
at a word of defense from the boy he lost his temper completely,
and, in a fit of exasperation, struck his apprentice.</p>

<p>The blow was not a severe one, and Bill could not have
suffered a twinge of pain. But his pride was hurt, and that
blow ended for him, as that larger, later blow ended for four
millions of others, his season of servitude.</p>

<p>"I'll quit you," he cried, trembling and almost weeping
with excitement and rage. "I'll list for a soldier."</p>

<p>We left the iron in a pile on the shabby floor, and followed
him with palpitating hearts to the little lobby of the
post-office. He was greeted with a chorus of shouts, as was
each new recruit, and a touch of ridicule must have mingled
with the hailing, for it straightened him and stiffened him
and sent him to the captain with as firm a front as ever was
borne by a novice.</p>

<p>If the men were changed by the donning of the blue, what
transformation was this wrought in our blacksmith boy?
He was inches taller and fathoms deeper. He was a man.
He stood about with the recruits, his brow darkening a
little when Carnahan approached, for he did not yet understand
the privilege of a warrior. But more than any other
man in uniform he was severed from civil life. He was
one of this wonderful legion that was filling the world with
comment&mdash;and filling the homes with woe. We came to
town that Saturday when the troops were mustered in, and
watched them drilling. We saw our blacksmith boy, and
wondered how we ever had addressed him, he was a being
so different from all he had been before. We saw the march
by twos and fours and company front, the double-quick and
the charge; and we heard the fledgling officers swear with
strange oaths at the men they were later to push into conflict.
We fancied Bill Bradley would not stand much of
that. We saw them march to the depot, and then wept, I
fear, at the passionate good-bys. There were fathers and
younger brothers and desolate wives; but the saddest of all
were the partings from mothers. It was so piteous, the
hopelessness of their despair, the utter abandon of their tears.</p>

<p>And then after much shaking of hands and waving of
hands the train was away. We saw load after load go by on
the cars after that, and always looked eagerly for the sight
of some face we knew. But the faces which we knew were
swallowed and lost in a sea of strangeness&mdash;a sea, we pray,
which never may grow familiar.</p>

<p>We read of the terrible battles that Western army fought;
we read of their victories, and the far too frequent defeats.
We read the lists of killed and wounded, and saw at last in
the longest column the name of Private William Bradley.
How far that name removed him from us! He was William
now&mdash;not common Bill; not Bill the blacksmith's bound boy.
We wondered if there was anything we could do for him,
and in the next box that went from our town mother sent
underclothes and stockings to the youth; for there was no
one near us by blood or friendship who weathered that
winter in the South, and no one near Bill to remember
him. And one day toward the dawn of spring a letter came
from the hospital, written in the clumsy hand of the orphan,
acknowledging the receipt of the clothes, and thanking for
them with the clumsy, genuine feeling of one who seldom
speaks and never forgets a favor. He was well again, he
said, and would be returned for duty in the morning. They
looked for another hard battle, for the enemy was massing,
and this new general that had won in the past believed in
sledge-hammers and decisive measures. At the end of the
letter was the sentence:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tha have mad me a corprl."</p>

<p>How proud he was of that&mdash;prouder of it than were the
thousands who had other things to comfort them. And how
near us he seemed to come as the weary months went by
and the fighting began again. Once fix your mind on a man
in the distance and a man who stands front face with danger
night and day and never flinches; and it is wonderful how
completely he will fill your sky. You imagine all manner of
great things about him, dread all manner of terrible things,
and end at last by loving him. So, when that other battle
was fought by the general who believed in sturdy blows,
and when Vicksburg laid down her arms at the feet of a
victorious army, we read again in the terrible lists of the
killed and wounded the name of our blacksmith boy. This
time, too, it was among the wounded&mdash;in the longest column;
but it bore a prefix that surprised us. It was "Sergeant
Bradley" now. The meager details of that time did not
help us to all the information we wanted. We did not know
how badly he was injured, but we sent a box of jellies and
pickles and things that are not issued with the rations; and
got another letter telling of the battle. And it makes no
difference how many of these reports you read in the paper,
this letter from a man who was in the thick of the fight
was far more authentic. It was far more real.</p>

<p>But Sergeant Bradley was sorely wounded this time. We
found more about it later when a letter from the captain
was printed in the county paper, detailing the events that had
been important from a subaltern's standpoint and boasting
of the prowess of his men. In this was told the story of a
Mississippi regiment, those tigers of the South&mdash;a charge
that was met by the tattered remnant of the Indiana brigade.
He told of the clashing of man against man, and the loss of
the banner over and over again&mdash;that banner that went
down to the army with the blessings of a thousand women
when Corinth fell. And it told how, when the howling,
shouting, slashing, shrieking legions swept the Northerners
back for a moment, and the guns were taken and not a thing
could live in the sea of triumphant assault, Corporal William
Bradley had wrapped his shattered arms about the flag and
rolled with it right under the guns that were turned against
his brethren.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come back again," said the hero, when
the charge was repulsed and the battery was recaptured.
"I knew you would come back, and I saved the flag."</p>

<p>He had, and he wore a sergeant's chevron for his heroism.
But the hurt would not heal. The sulphurous smoke, the
fearful concussions of earth and air as he burrowed under
the guns and waited for rescue, the sword thrusts and bayonet
pricks, the white flesh torn by whistling ball, and the
two bones broken by the shattered shell&mdash;all this was tribulation
which would not pass away. Sergeant Bradley lay
long in the hospital.</p>

<p>One night in the autumn, as we sat there under a waning
moon and listened to the shrill complaint of a hidden cicada,
we were conscious of a figure making slow progress along
the path by the roadside. It was a man, and even in the
darkness of night we could see it was not familiar. For the
matter of that, the figure of a man at all those days was not
a common thing. Men were away in the South, as a general
rule. But this figure grew stranger as it came nearer.
Presently the gate swung open, and the watch-dog gave challenge.
We silenced him and rose to meet a limping, swaying
figure in Federal blue. He said nothing, and seemed, with
that grinning insistence of the uncouth man, to wish we
might remember him. We had filled our thought with Bradley,
no doubt; but this could not be he.</p>

<p>It was, however, and when we were sure of that we gave
him a welcome and hearty cheer. But he was very weak.
It seemed, after the first timid acceptance of our greeting,
he began to fail, and to take less and less of interest in the
things about him. We thought he would like to hear news
from town. He had forgotten all about the town. We
hoped a little later he would enjoy a word of cheer from
the front. There was no army for him now. He lay there
so white on the pillow, his red hair making the whiteness
more vivid; his blue eyes looking so steadily, yet so listlessly,
at a single point in the wall; he stirred so slightly at the
passing of day and night&mdash;and then he closed his eyes.</p>

<p>It was long before he opened them again. When he did
he saw mother beside him. She was cooling the cloth she
laid on his forehead.</p>

<p>"I thought I wanted to come home," he said, and then
closed his eyes again. There was no relevancy in the remark.
No one had spoken to him, and there had never
been a thought of this or other place as a home for him.
It must have been on his mind all the time.</p>

<p>But there was youth to support him, and the blessings of
twenty years to pour their vigor into his veins. His mending
was slow, but it was sure. He walked about the farm at
Thanksgiving, and returned to duty at Christmas. He was
a different man. It seemed impossible he ever could have
been a bound boy. He was dignified, self-reliant. He spoke
easily and without embarrassment, no matter if it was a
general addressed. And he was a lieutenant when the war
was done.</p>

<p>No, he didn't die. He lived to remember twenty battles
and a dozen wounds. He lived to make a modest beginning
in business, and to follow it to comfortable success. He owns
his home now and under his broad hat hides red hair that
will never be quite gray. He stands to-day with his children
at the graves of the men who were with him in the
army, who were with him in danger and suffering and success.
He stands with those children and tells them the
story and the lesson of the day.</p>

<p>To him it was the working out of a problem, the right
solution after years of wrong. To him and to me his record
typifies the average of that darker period. Thousands and
tens of thousands went in with a whim to come out with a
halo. They enlisted under the spur of example, of banter,
of pique. Yet they fought like Greeks, and forgave like
Christians. It was the hand of the common man that left
home duties and home obligations to take up the greater
cause of a nation. It was the triumph of simplicity&mdash;that
silent legion which boasted little before the war, and never
complained when hardship came. It was the triumph of all
that is good in the American who lives to see the realization
of dreams that were not bold enough to paint their horoscope
when prophecy was loudest.</p>

<h2><a name="A_WINTER_STORY_OF_COLORADO" id="A_WINTER_STORY_OF_COLORADO">A WINTER STORY OF COLORADO.</a></h2>


<p>The wild beasts upon Hicks Mountain were limited almost
entirely to the coyotes; these persisted, in spite of advancing
settlement, but in this section of Colorado the grey wolf,
the mountain-lion, and the bear had been practically exterminated.
For five years the stock had run the hills quite
unmolested. A coyote will kill sheep, but its depredations
are confined otherwise to the poultry, barring now and then
a sick and abandoned calf.</p>

<p>However, in the winter of 1905, rumors spread that the
grey wolves had returned. Calves were being killed and
eaten, sows mutilated, and even large steers torn about the
legs and chest. One rancher discovered in the timber across
the pasture from his house the remains of a yearling heifer
killed only that night; whatever had attacked it had devoured
it, hide and all, to the very largest bones, leaving only the
scattered remnants of a skeleton.</p>

<p>Now, a mountain-lion would have eaten part and buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the rest; a bear would also have eaten part, and saved the
rest for later; coyotes would only have gnawed and mangled
the carcass; the great grey wolf alone would have worked
a destruction so complete.</p>

<p>The ground was bare of snow, and covered with pine-needles,
thus being unfavorable for tracks. Mr. Jeffries had
heard no howling. Nevertheless, the grey wolf, the stockman's
scourge, was blamed.</p>

<p>Traps were set, and poisoned meat was discreetly put out,
but only the coyotes suffered, apparently. Then Ned Coswell,
early one morning, while searching for a lost milk-cow, came
over a little rise, and saw below him in a hollow in the park
a number of wolfish animals collected about a dead body,
tearing at it. Ned was unarmed, but, spurring his horse,
he rode down upon them recklessly, whooping.</p>

<p>"There were about a dozen of them," related Ned, "and I
knew they weren't wolves, because they were colored differently,
more like dogs. They looked at me coming, and,
boys, I didn't know for a minute whether they were going
to get out of the way or not. Old Medicine Eye"&mdash;his horse&mdash;"wasn't
a bit afraid; just pricked his ears and kept on,
which made me think all the more they weren't wolves.</p>

<p>"They were dogs, boys, nothing but dogs. There was a
brindled one that looked like a bulldog, and several woolly
dogs, like sheep-dogs, and one big black-and-white shaggy
fellow, biggest of all. They all lifted their heads, and stood
staring at me, and I was beginning to think that maybe I'd
been in too much of a hurry. But first one sneaked off,
showing his teeth, into the brush, and another and another,
and they all went, and I was mighty glad to have them go.
They'd been eating at a dead steer&mdash;mine, too&mdash;but I don't
know whether they'd killed it or not. I wish I'd had a gun."</p>

<p>After that the ranchers made it a habit again to carry a
gun of some kind when out on the range. However, for a
long time nobody, when armed, caught any glimpse of the
wild dogs. That is likely to be the case in hunting; the
unprepared frequently have the opportunities.</p>

<p>For instance, Frank Warring, while on his way home from
town in his wagon, toward evening of a cloudy day, beheld
the pack cross the road right in front of him, the animals
in single file, one following another, silent as specters, noses
outstretched, the big, shaggy black-and-white fellow leading.
In the rear were two or three puppies, perhaps nine months
old. Frank had no gun. Somebody else also saw the pack.</p>

<p>The brutes' depredations continued, being limited, so far
as we could ascertain, to our vicinity, as if they had selected
Hicks Mountain for a hunting-ground. They hunted without
howling. A spasmodic, rabid bark was the only sound that
we could attribute to them, but it was sufficient.</p>

<p>We were afraid of this wild pack; more afraid than of
wolves. There is something uncanny about a dog gone wild,
for he combines the lessons taught by domesticity with the
instincts of savagery.</p>

<p>As nobody from our section had missed dogs, we concluded
that this band had come down upon us from Wyoming, a
hundred and fifty miles north. Up in Wyoming wild dogs
had been bothering the sheep-range. Probably energetic
measures adopted by the irate sheep men had driven the
marauders to seek new fields.</p>

<p>Finally, Sam Morris had a chance to retaliate. He was
hunting deer afoot. The day was dark and snowy. As he
was sitting motionless beside a boulder, watching the slope
below and the ascent across the draw, the dog-pack suddenly
streamed out from the pines down there, and all at a lope
threaded the bottom of the draw, onward bound. The
shaggy black-and-white was leading, as usual.</p>

<p>Sam's gun was loaded with buckshot, and he waited greedily,
that he might get more than one dog with his charge.
But the animals were too shrewd to travel bunched; they
left intervals, as do the wolves when trailing, and when at
last Sam would desperately have "whanged away," his gun
missed fire. Rather chagrined was Sam, telling his tale
afterward. He confirmed the previous statements that the
pack was variously colored, made up of different breeds; a
strange invasion surely.</p>

<p>The trail through the draw remained unobliterated, for no
snow fell for two weeks thereafter. We found that the dog-pack
was utilizing this draw for a pass. It appeared to lead
from one favorite point to another. The trail grew more
distinct, but it scarcely widened; the dogs stepped always,
so it seemed, in the same spots. It was vain to set traps;
the disturbance of the snow was noticed at once. Poison
was disregarded. The pack kept on ranging the country and
attacking stock.</p>

<p>Sam was anxious to retrieve himself, and he and I agreed
to put in our time watching that trail until we should "fix"
some of those outlaws. I remember that it was the tenth day
of January, and toward four o'clock in the afternoon, when,
for perhaps the sixth or seventh time, we ensconced ourselves
between two boulders on the slope overlooking the trail
below.</p>

<p>The sky was cloudy; a snowstorm was evidently approaching.
Cloudy days seemed to be those upon which the dog-pack
was most likely to be sighted. Probably upon such
days it emerged earlier on account of the waning light. This
afternoon we had been in ambush only a half-hour when the
pack appeared.</p>

<p>In silent, single file the pack came trotting out of the
timber on our right, and across before us, following the
trail in the draw. The big, black-and-white, shaggy fellow
was the first; next to him was the brindle. I recognized
them, for every narrative had contained them.</p>

<p>I don't know exactly why, but the sight of them all, trotting
so silently, so swiftly, business-bent, thrilled me with a
little chill. About their steady gait was something ominous,
unreal. A pack of wolves I could have surveyed without
special emotion, for I should have known what to expect,
but a pack of dogs, gone wild&mdash;ugh! They are neither dogs
nor wolves, but, as has been said, an uncanny blending.</p>

<p>We had agreed what to do. Sam only nudged me, and
levelled his gun. There was an instant of suspense, and we
fired practically together.</p>

<p>We had rifles, and were using black powder, and the
smoke was momentarily thick. When it cleared, the shaggy
leader was kicking in the snow, and the brindle was lying
still. My bullet had not sped quite as truly as Sam's; his
aim had been the brindle. The rest of the pack were racing
madly onward, and although we fired twice more, we did not
hit any of them.</p>

<p>We went down to our victims. The brindle had just life
enough in him to snarl at us ere he died. The big black-and-white
was gasping.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing occurred. As I stood over him, he
wagged his bushy tail; his eyes were not wild, but soft, suffering,
appealing. He was now all dog and would turn to
his chosen friend, man, for sympathy and aid.</p>

<p>"Poor old chap!" I said.</p>

<p>His eyes were glazing fast; he hauled himself on his side
over the snow toward me.</p>

<p>"Look out!" warned Sam.</p>

<p>But there was no need. With a final effort, the animal
just managed to lick my boot-toe, and with his head upon it,
he shivered and was still. I declare, a lump rose in my
throat.</p>

<p>As I bent to pat his coat&mdash;I love dogs, and he had struck
me right to the heart, marauder though he had been&mdash;I felt
a collar round his neck, concealed by his long, curly hair.
Upon the collar was a plate, engraved "Prince." Somebody's
"Prince" had he been, somebody's pet. But whose?</p>

<p>A more perfect example of atavism, reversion to type&mdash;call
it what you will&mdash;would be hard to present.</p>

<p>The dog-pack never again, as far as there was evidence,
traversed that trail. Nor was it seen again upon Hicks
Mountain. It seemed almost as if it had been composed of
weird phantoms, like the spectral packs of German and Provençal
legend, and had dissolved at our gunshots.</p>
